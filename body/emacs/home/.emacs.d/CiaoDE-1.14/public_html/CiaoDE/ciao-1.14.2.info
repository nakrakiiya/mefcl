Summary
*******

*Ciao* is a _public domain_, _next generation_ multi-paradigm
programming environment with a unique set of features:

   * *Ciao* offers a complete Prolog system, supporting _ISO-Prolog_,
     but its novel modular design allows both _restricting_ and
     _extending_ the language. As a result, it allows working with
     _fully declarative subsets_ of Prolog and also to _extend_ these
     subsets (or ISO-Prolog) both syntactically and semantically.
     Most importantly, these restrictions and extensions can be
     activated separately on each program module so that several
     extensions can coexist in the same application for different
     modules.

   * *Ciao* also supports (through such extensions) programming with
     functions, higher-order (with predicate abstractions),
     constraints, and objects, as well as feature terms (records),
     persistence, several control rules (breadth-first search,
     iterative deepening, ...), concurrency (threads/engines), a good
     base for distributed execution (agents), and parallel execution.
     Libraries also support WWW programming, sockets, external
     interfaces (C, Java, TclTk, relational databases, etc.), etc.

   * *Ciao* offers support for _programming in the large_ with a
     robust module/object system, module-based separate/incremental
     compilation (automatically -no need for makefiles), an assertion
     language for declaring (_optional_) program properties
     (including types and modes, but also determinacy, non-failure,
     cost, etc.), automatic static inference and static/dynamic
     checking of such assertions, etc.

   * *Ciao* also offers support for _programming in the small_
     producing small executables (including only those libraries
     actually used by the program) and support for writing scripts.

   * The *Ciao* programming environment includes a classical
     top-level and a rich emacs interface with an embeddable
     source-level debugger and a number of execution visualization
     tools.

   * The *Ciao* compiler (which can be run outside the top level
     shell) generates several forms of architecture-independent and
     stand-alone executables, which run with speed, efficiency, and
     executable size which are very competitive with other commercial
     and academic languages (including other Prolog/CLP systems).
     Library modules can be compiled into compact bytecode or C
     source files, and linked statically, dynamically, or autoloaded.

   * The novel modular design of *Ciao* enables, in addition to
     modular program development, effective global program analysis
     and static debugging and optimization via source to source
     program transformation. These tasks are performed by the *Ciao
     preprocessor* ( `ciaopp', distributed separately).

   * The *Ciao* programming environment also includes `lpdoc', an
     automatic documentation generator for LP/CLP programs. It
     processes source files adorned with (*Ciao*) assertions and
     machine-readable comments and generates manuals in many formats
     including `postscript', `pdf', `texinfo', `info', `HTML', `man',
     etc. , as well as on-line help, ascii `README' files, entries
     for indices of manuals (`info', WWW, ...), and maintains WWW
     distribution sites.


   *Ciao* is distributed under the GNU Library General Public License
(LGPL).

1.1 About this manual
=====================

This is the _Reference Manual_ for the Ciao development system. It
contains basic information on how to install Ciao and how to write,
debug, and run Ciao programs from the command line, from inside GNU `emacs',
or from a windowing desktop. It also documents all the libraries
available in the standard distribution.

   This manual has been generated using the _LPdoc_ semi-automatic
documentation generator for LP/CLP programs [HC97,Her00].  `lpdoc'
processes Ciao files (and files in Prolog and other CLP languages)
adorned with assertions and machine-readable comments, which should
be written in the Ciao assertion language [PBH97,PBH00]. From these,
it generates manuals in many formats including `postscript', `pdf',
`texinfo', `info', `HTML', `man', etc., as well as on-line help,
ascii `README' files, entries for indices of manuals (`info', WWW,
...), and maintains WWW distribution sites.

   The big advantage of this approach is that it is easier to keep
the on-line and printed documentation in sync with the source code
[Knu84]. As a result, _this manual changes continually as the source
code is modified_. Because of this, the manual has a version number.
You should make sure the manual you are reading, whether it be
printed or on-line, coincides with the version of the software that
you are using.

   The approach also implies that there is often a variability in the
degree to which different libraries or system components are
documented. Many libraries offer abundant documentation, but a few
will offer little. The latter is due to the fact that we tend to
include libraries in the manual if the code is found to be useful,
even if they may still contain sparse documentation. This is because
including a library in the manual will at the bare minimum provide
formal information (such as the names of exported predicates and
their arity, which other modules it loads, etc.), create index
entries, pointers for on-line help in the electronic versions of the
manuals, and command-line completion capabilities inside `emacs'.
Again, the manual is being updated continuously as the different
libraries (and machine-readable documentation in them) are improved.

1.2 About the Ciao development system
=====================================

The Ciao system is a full programming environment for developing
programs in the Prolog language and in several other languages which
are extensions and modifications of Prolog and (Constraint) Logic
Programming in several interesting and useful directions. The
programming environment offers a number of tools such as the Ciao
standalone compiler (`ciaoc'), a traditional-style top-level
interactive shell (`ciaosh' or `ciao'), an interpreter of scripts
written in Ciao (`ciao-shell'), a Ciao (and Prolog) `emacs' mode
(which greatly helps the task of developing programs with support for
editing, debugging, version/change tracking, etc.), numerous
libraries, a powerful program preprocessor (`ciaopp'
[BGH99,BLGPH04,HBPLG99], which supports static debugging and
optimization from program analysis via source to source program
transformation), and an automatic documentation generator (`lpdoc')
[HC97,Her00]. A number of execution visualization tools
[CGH93,CH00d,CH00c] are also available.

   This manual documents the first four of the tools mentioned above
[see PART I - The program development environment], and the Ciao
language and libraries. The `ciaopp' and `lpdoc' tools are documented
in separate manuals.

   The Ciao language [see PART II - The Ciao basic language (engine)]
has been designed from the ground up to be small, but to also allow
extensions and restrictions in a modular way. The first objective
allows producing small executables (including only those builtins
used by the program), providing basic support for pure logic
programming, and being able to write scripts in Ciao. The second one
allows supporting standard ISO-Prolog [see PART III - ISO-Prolog
library (iso)], as well as powerful extensions such as constraint
logic programming, functional logic programming, and object-oriented
logic programming [see PART VII - Ciao extensions], and restrictions
such as working with pure horn clauses.

   The design of Ciao has also focused on allowing modular program
development, as well as automatic program manipulation and
optimization. Ciao includes a robust module system [CH00a],
module-based automatic incremental compilation [CH99b], and modular
global program analysis, debugging and optimization [PH99], based on
a rich assertion language [see PART V - Assertions, Properties,
Types, Modes, Comments (assertions)] for declaring (optional) program
properties (including types and modes), which can be checked either
statically or dynamically. The program analysis, static debugging and
optimization tasks related to these assertions are performed by the
`ciaopp' preprocessor, as mentioned above. These assertions (together
with special comment-style declarations) are also the ones used by
the `lpdoc' autodocumenter to generate documentation for programs
(the comment-style declarations are documented in the `lpdoc' manual).

   Ciao also includes several other features and utilities, such as
support for several forms of executables, concurrency (threads),
distributed and parallel execution, higher-order, WWW programming
(PiLLoW [CHV96b]), interfaces to other languages like C and Java,
database interfaces, graphical interfaces, etc., etc. [see PARTS VI
to XI].


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: ISO-Prolog compliance versus extensibility,  Next: About the name of the System,  Prev: About the Ciao development system,  Up: Introduction

1.3 ISO-Prolog compliance versus extensibility
==============================================

One of the innovative features of Ciao is that it has been designed
to subsume _ISO-Prolog_ (International Standard ISO/IEC 13211-1,
PROLOG: Part 1-General Core [DEDC96]), while at the same time
extending it in many important ways. The intention is to ensure that
all ISO-compliant Prolog programs run correctly under Ciao. At the
same time, the Ciao module system (see [PART II - The Ciao basic
language (engine)] and [CH00a] for a discussion of the motivations
behind the design) allows selectively avoiding the loading of most
ISO-builtins (and changing some other ISO characteristics) when not
needed, so that it is possible to work with purer subsets of Prolog
and also to build small executables. Also, this module system makes
it possible to develop extensions using these purer subsets (or even
the full ISO-standard) as a starting point. Using these features, the
Ciao distribution includes libraries which significantly extend the
language both syntactically and semantically.

   Compliance with ISO is still not complete: currently there are
some minor deviations in, e.g., the treatment of characters, the
syntax, some of the arithmetic functions, and part of the error
system. On the other hand, Ciao has been reported by independent
sources (members of the standarization body) to be one of the most
conforming Prologs at the moment of this writing, and the first one
to be able to compile all the standard-conforming test cases. Also,
Ciao does not offer a strictly conforming mode which rejects uses of
non-ISO features. However, in order to aid programmers who wish to
write standard compliant programs, library predicates that correspond
to those in the ISO-Prolog standard are marked specially in the
manuals, and differences between the Ciao and the prescribed
ISO-Prolog behaviours, if any, are commented appropriately.

   The intention of the Ciao developers is to progressively complete
the compliance of Ciao with the published parts of the ISO standard
as well as with other reasonable extensions of the standard may be
published in the future. However, since one of the design objectives
of Ciao is to address some shortcomings of previous implementations
of Prolog and logic programming in general, we also hope that some of
the better ideas present in the system will make it eventually into
other systems and the standards.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: About the name of the System,  Next: Referring to Ciao,  Prev: ISO-Prolog compliance versus extensibility,  Up: Introduction

1.4 About the name of the System
================================

Ciao is often referred to as "Ciao Prolog," a name which has an
interesting (and not unintended) interpretation. Ciao is an
interesting word which means both _hello_ and _goodbye_. 'Ciao
Prolog' intends to be a really good, all-round, freely available
ISO-Prolog system which can be used as a classical Prolog, in both
academic and industrial environments (and, in particular, to
introduce users to Prolog and to constraint and logic programming
-the _hello_ part). An indeed many programmers use it just that way.
But Ciao is also a new-generation, multiparadigm programming language
and program development system which goes well beyond Prolog and
other classical logic programming languages. And it has the advantage
(when compared to other new-generation LP systems) that it does so
while keeping full Prolog compatibility when needed.

1.6 Syntax terminology and notational conventions
=================================================

This manual assumes some familiarity with logic programming and the
Prolog language. The reader is referred to standard textbooks on
logic programming and Prolog (such as, e.g., [SS86,CM81,Apt97,Hog84])
for background. However, we would like to refresh herein some
concepts for the sake of establishing terminology. Also, we will
briefly introduce a few of the extensions that Ciao brings to the
Prolog language.

* Menu:

* Predicates and their components::
* Characters and character strings::
* Predicate specs::
* Modes::
* Properties and types::
* Declarations::
* Operators::


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Predicates and their components,  Next: Characters and character strings,  Prev: Syntax terminology and notational conventions,  Up: Syntax terminology and notational conventions

1.6.1 Predicates and their components
-------------------------------------

Procedures are called _predicates_ and predicate calls _literals_.
They all have the classical syntax of procedures (and of logic
predications and of mathematical functions). Predicates are
identified in this manual by a keyword 'PREDICATE' at the right
margin of the place where they are documented.

   Program instructions are expressions made up of control constructs
(*note Control constructs/predicates::) and literals, and are called
_goals_. Literals are also (atomic) goals.

   A predicate definition is a sequence of clauses. A clause has the
form "`H :- B.'" (ending in '`.''), where `H' is syntactically the
same as a literal and is called the clause _head_, and `B' is a goal
and is called the clause _body_. A clause with no body is written
"`H.'" and is called a _fact_. Clauses with body are also called
_rules_. A program is a sequence of predicate definitions.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Characters and character strings,  Next: Predicate specs,  Prev: Predicates and their components,  Up: Syntax terminology and notational conventions

1.6.2 Characters and character strings
--------------------------------------

We adopt the following convention for delineating character strings
in the text of this manual: when a string is being used as an atom it
is written thus: `user' or `'user''; but in all other circumstances
double quotes are used (as in `"hello"').

   When referring to keyboard characters, printing characters are
written thus: <a>, while control characters are written like this:
<^A>. Thus <^C> is the character you get by holding down the <CTL>
key while you type <c>. Finally, the special control characters
carriage-return, line-feed and space are often abbreviated to <RET>,
<LFD> and <SPC> respectively.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Predicate specs,  Next: Modes,  Prev: Characters and character strings,  Up: Syntax terminology and notational conventions

1.6.3 Predicate specs
---------------------

Predicates are distinguished by their name _and_ their arity. We will
call `name/arity' a _predicate spec_. The notation `name/arity' is
therefore used when it is necessary to refer to a predicate
unambiguously. For example, `concatenate/3' specifies the predicate
which is named "concatenate" and which takes 3 arguments.

   (Note that different predicates may have the same name and
different arity. Conversely, of course, they may have the same arity
and different name.)

1.6.4 Modes
-----------

When documenting a predicate, we will often describe its usage with a mode
spec which has the form `name(Arg1, ..., ArgN)' where each `Arg' may
be preceded by a _mode_. A mode is a functor which is wrapped around
an argument (or prepended if defined as an operator). Such a mode
allows documenting in a compact way the instantiation state on call
and exit of the argument to which it is applied. The set of modes
which can be used in Ciao is not fixed. Instead, arbitrary modes can
be defined by in programs using the `modedef/1' declarations of the
Ciao _assertion language_ (*note The Ciao assertion package:: for
details). Modes are identified in this manual by a keyword 'MODE'.

   Herein, we will use the set of modes defined in the Ciao `isomodes'
library, which is essentially the same as those used in the ISO-Prolog
standard (*note ISO-Prolog modes::).

1.6.5 Properties and types
--------------------------

Although Ciao is _not_ a typed language, it allows writing (and
using) types, as well as (more general) properties. There may be
properties of the states and of the computation. Properties of the
states allow expressing characteristics of the program variables
during computation, like in `sorted(X)' (`X' is a sorted list).
Properties of the computation allow expressing characteristics of a
whole computation, like in `is_det(p(X,Y))' (such calls yield only
one solution). Properties are just a special form of predicates
(*note Declaring regular types::) and are identified in this manual
by a keyword 'PROPERTY'.

   Ciao types are _regular types_ (*note Declaring regular types::),
which are a special form of properties themselves. They are
identified in this manual by a keyword 'REGTYPE'.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Declarations,  Next: Operators,  Prev: Properties and types,  Up: Syntax terminology and notational conventions

1.6.6 Declarations
------------------

A _declaration_ provides information to one of the Ciao environment
tools. Declarations are interspersed in the code of a program.
Usually the target tool is either the compiler (telling it that a
predicate is dynamic, or a meta-predicate, etc.), the preprocessor
(which understands declarations of properties and types, assertions,
etc.), or the autodocumenter (which understands the previous
declarations and also certain "comment" declarations).

   A declaration has the form `:- D.' where `D' is syntactically the
same as a literal. Declarations are identified in this manual by a
keyword 'DECLARATION'.

   In Ciao users can define (and document) new declarations. New
declarations are typically useful when defining extensions to the
language (which in Ciao are called packages). Such extensions are
often implemented as expansions (see *note Extending the syntax::).
There are many such extensions in Ciao. The `functions' library,
which provides fuctional syntax, is an example. The fact that in Ciao
expansions are local to modules (as operators, see below) makes it
possible to use a certain language extension in one module without
affecting other modules.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Operators,  Prev: Declarations,  Up: Syntax terminology and notational conventions

1.6.7 Operators
---------------

An _operator_ is a functor (or predicate name) which has been
declared as such, thus allowing its use in a prefix, infix, or suffix
fashion, instead of the standard procedure-like fashion. E.g.,
declaring `+' as an infix operator allows writing `X+Y' instead of
`'+'(X,Y)' (which may still, of course, be written).

   _Operators in Ciao are local to the module/file where they are
declared_. However, some operators are standard and allowed in every
program (see *note Defining operators::). This manual documents the
operator declarations in each (library) module where they are
included. As with expansions, the fact that in Ciao operators are
local to modules makes it possible to use a certain language
extension in one module without affecting other modules.

1.7.1 PART I - The program development environment
--------------------------------------------------

This part documents the components of the basic Ciao program
development environment. They include:

ciaoc:
     the standalone compiler, which creates executables without
     having to enter the interactive top-level.

ciaosh:
     (also invoked simply as `ciao') is an interactive top-level
     shell, similar to the one found on most Prolog systems (with
     some enhancements).

debugger.pl:
     a Byrd box-type debugger, similar to the one found on most
     Prolog systems (also with some enhancements, such as
     source-level debugging). This is not a standalone application,
     but is rather included in `ciaosh', as is done in other systems
     supporting the Prolog language. However, it is also
     _embeddable_, in the sense that it can be included as a library
     in executables, and activated dynamically and conditionally
     while such executables are running.

ciao-shell:
     an interpreter/compiler for _Ciao scripts_ (i.e., files
     containing Ciao code which run without needing explicit
     compilation).

ciao.el:
     a _complete program development enviroment_, based on GNU emacs,
     with syntax coloring, direct access to all the tools described
     above (as well as the preprocessor and the documenter), atomatic
     location of errors, source-level debugging, context-sensitive
     access to on-line help/manuals, etc. The use of this environment
     is _very highly recommended_!


   The Ciao program development environment also includes `ciaopp',
the preprocessor, and `lpdoc', the documentation generator, which are
described in separate manuals.

1.7.2 PART II - The Ciao basic language (engine)
------------------------------------------------

This part documents the _Ciao basic builtins_. These predefined
predicates and declarations are available in every program, unless the `pure'
package is used (by using a `:- module(_,_,[pure]).' declaration or
`:- use_package(pure).'). These predicates are contained in the
`engine' directory within the `lib' library.  The rest of the library
predicates, including the packages that provide most of the ISO-Prolog
builtins, are documented in subsequent parts.

1.7.3 PART III - ISO-Prolog library (iso)
-----------------------------------------

This part documents the _iso_ package which provides to Ciao programs
(most of) the ISO-Prolog functionality, including the _ISO-Prolog
builtins_ not covered by the basic library.

1.7.4 PART IV - Classic Prolog library (classic)
------------------------------------------------

This part documents some Ciao libraries which provide additional
predicates and functionalities that, despite not being in the ISO
standard, are present in many popular Prolog systems. This includes
definite clause grammars (DCGs), "Quintus-style" internal database,
list processing predicates, DEC-10 Prolog-style input/output,
formatted output, dynamic loading of modules, activation of operators
at run-time, etc.

1.7.5 PART V - Assertions, Properties, Types, Modes, Comments (assertions)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ciao allows _annotating_ the program code with _assertions_. Such
assertions include type and instantiation mode declarations, but also
more general properties as well as comments for _autodocumentation_
in the _literate programming_ style. These assertions document
predicates (and modules and whole applications) and can be used by
the Ciao preprocessor/compiler while debugging and optimizing the
program or library, and by the Ciao documenter to build program or
library reference manuals.

1.7.6 PART VI - Ciao library miscellanea
----------------------------------------

This part documents several Ciao libraries which provide different
useful additional functionality. Such functionality includes
performing operating system calls, gathering statistics from the Ciao
engine, file and filename manipulation, error and exception handling,
fast reading and writing of terms ( marshalling and unmarshalling),
file locking, issuing program and error messages, pretty-printing
programs and assertions, a browser of the system libraries,
additional expansion utilities, concurrent aggregates, graph
visualization, etc.

1.7.7 PART VII - Ciao extensions
--------------------------------

The libraries documented in this part extend the Ciao language in
several different ways. The extensions include:

   * pure Prolog programming (well, this can be viewed more as a
     restriction than an extension);

   * feature terms or _records_ (i.e., structures with names for each
     field);

   * parallel programming (e.g., &-Prolog style);

   * functional syntax;

   * higher-order;

   * global variables;

   * `setarg' and `undo';

   * delaying predicate execution;

   * active modules;

   * breadth-first execution;

   * iterative deepening-based execution;

   * constraint logic programming;

   * object oriented programming.

-----------------------------------------------------------

The following interfaces to/from Ciao are documented in this part:

   * External interface (e.g., to C).

   * Socket interface.

   * Tcl/tk interface.

   * Web interface (http, html, xml, etc.);

   * Persistent predicate databases (interface between the Ciao
     internal database and the external file system).

   * SQL-like database interface (interface between the Ciao internal
     database and external SQL/ODBC systems).

   * Java interface.

   * Calling emacs from Ciao.

structures (abstract data types) that are used frequently in programs
or in the Ciao system itself.

1.8 Acknowledgments
===================

The Ciao system is a joint effort on one side of some present ( Francisco
Bueno, Manuel Carro, Manuel Hermenegildo, _Pedro Lo'pez_, and _Germa'n
Puebla_) and past ( Daniel Cabeza, _Mari'a Jose' Garci'a de la
Banda_) members of the _CLIP group_ at the School of Computer Science, _Technical
University of Madrid_ and at the _IMDEA Software Institute_, and on
the other side of several colleagues and students that have
collaborated with us over the years of its development. The following
is an (inevitably incomplete) list of those that have contributed
most significantly to the development of Ciao:

   * The _Ciao engine_, compiler, preprocessor, libraries, and
     documentation, although completely rewritten at this point, have
     their origins in the _&-Prolog_ _parallel Prolog_ engine and _parallelizing
     compiler_, developed by Manuel Hermenegildo, Kevin Greene, Kalyan
     Muthukumar, and Roger Nasr at _MCC_ and later at _UPM_. The
     &-Prolog engine and low-level ( _WAM_) compilers in turn were
     derived from early versions (0.5 to 0.7) of _SICStus Prolog_
     [Car88]. SICStus is an excellent, high performance Prolog
     system, developed by Mats Carlsson and colleagues at the _Swedish
     Institute of Computer Science_ ( _SICS_), that every user of
     Prolog should check out [Swe95,AAF91]. Very special thanks are
     due to Seif Haridi, Mats Carlsson, and colleagues at SICS for
     allowing the SICStus 0.5-0.7 components in _&-Prolog_ and its
     successor, Ciao, to be distributed freely. Parts of the parallel
     abstract machine have been developed in collaboration with Gopal
     Gupta and Enrico Pontelli ( _New Mexico State University_).

   * Many aspects of the analyzers in the _Ciao preprocessor_ ( `ciaopp')
     have been developed in collaboration with Peter Stuckey ( _Melbourne
     U._), Kim Marriott ( _Monash U._), Maurice Bruynooghe, Gerda
     Janssens, Anne Mulkers, and Veroniek Dumortier ( _K.U. Leuven_),
     and Saumya Debray ( _U. of Arizona_). The assertion system has
     been developed in collaboration with Jan Maluzynski and Wlodek
     Drabent ( _Linkoping U._) and Pierre Deransart ( _INRIA_). The
     core of type inference system derives from the system developed
     by John Gallagher [GdW94] ( _Bristol University_) and later
     adapted to CLP(FD) by Pawel Pietrzak ( _Linkoping U._).

   * The constraint solvers for _R_ and _Q_ are derived from the code
     developed by Christian Holzbauer ( _Austrian Research Institute
     for AI_ in Vienna) [Hol94,Hol90,Hol92].

   * The Ciao manuals include material from the _DECsystem-10 Prolog
     User's Manual_ by D.L. Bowen (editor), L. Byrd, F.C.N. Pereira, L.M.
     Pereira, and D.H.D. Warren [BBP81]. They also contain material
     from the SICStus Prolog user manuals for SICStus versions
     0.5-0.7 by Mats Carlsson and Johan Widen [Car88], as well as
     from the Prolog ISO standard documentation [DEDC96].

   * Ciao is designed to be highly extendable in a modular way. Many
     of the libraries distributed with Ciao have been developed by
     other people all of which is impossible to mention here.
     Individual author names are included in the documentation of
     each library and appear in the indices.

   * The development of the Ciao system has been supported in part by
     European research projects PEPMA, ACCLAIM, PARFORCE, DISCIPL, AMOS, ASAP, MOBIUS,
     and SCUBE; by MICYT projects IPL-D, ELLA, EDIPIA, CUBICO, MERIT,
     and DOVES; and by CM projects PROMESAS and PROMETIDOS.


   If you feel you have contributed to the development of Ciao and we
have forgotten to add your name to this list or to the
acknowledgements given in the different chapters and indices, please
let us know and we will be glad to give proper credits.

1.9 Version/Change Log
======================

*Version 1.14#2 (2011/8/12, 18:14:31 CEST)*
     Merging r13606 (trunk) into 1.14. This backports an optimization
     for DARWIN platforms (Jose Morales)

*Version 1.14#1 (2011/8/10, 18:17:10 CEST)*
     Merging r13583 through r13586 (trunk) into 1.14. This fixes
     problems in the Windows version of Ciao (Edison Mera, Jose
     Morales)

*Version 1.14 (2011/7/8, 10:51:55 CEST)*
     It has been a long while since declaring the last major version
     (basically since moving to subversion after 1.10/1.12), so quite
     a bit is included in this release. Here is the (longish) summary:

        * Extensions to functional notation:
             * Introduced `fsyntax' package (just functional syntax).
               (Daniel Cabeza)

             * Added support to define on the fly a return argument
               different from the default one (e.g.
               `~functor(~,f,2)'). (Daniel Cabeza)

             * Use of '`:- function(defined(true)).'' so that the
               defined function does not need to be preceded by `~'
               in the return expression of a functional clause.
               (Daniel Cabeza)

             * Functional notation: added to documentation to reflect
               more of the FLOPS paper text and explanations. Added
               new functional syntax examples: arrays, combination
               with constraints, using func notation for properties,
               lazy evaluation, etc. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Added functional abstractions to `fsyntax' and correct
               handling of predicate abstractions (the functions in
               the body where expanded outside the abstraction).
               (Jose Morales)

             * Improved translation of functions. In particular, old
               translation could lose last call optimization for
               functions with body or with conditional expressions.
               Furthermore, the translation avoids now some
               superfluous intermediate unifications. To be studied
               more involved optimizations. (Daniel Cabeza, Jose
               Morales).

             * More superfluous unifications taken out from
               translated code, in cases where a goal `~f(X) =
               /Term/' appears in the body. (Daniel Cabeza)

             * Added `library/argnames_fsyntax.pl': Package to be
               able to use `$~/2' as an operator. (Daniel Cabeza)

             * Added a new example for lazy evaluation, saving memory
               using lazy instead of eager evaluation. (Amadeo Casas)

        * Improvements to signals and exceptions:
             * Distinguished between exceptions and signals.
               Exceptions are thrown and caught (using `throw/1' and `catch/3').
               Signals are sent and intercepted (using `send_signal/1'
               and `intercept/3'). (Jose Morales, Remy Haemmerle)

             * Back-port of the (improved) low-level exception
               handling from `optim_comp' branch. (Jose Morales)

             * Fixed `intercept/3' bug, with caused the toplevel to
               not properly handle exceptions after one was handled
               and displayed (bug reported by Samir Genaim on 04 Dec
               05, in ciao mailing list, subject "`ciao top-level :
               exception handling'"). Updated documentation. (Daniel
               Cabeza)

             * `intercept/3' does not leave pending choice points if
               the called goal is deterministic (the same
               optimization that was done for `catch/3'). (Jose
               Morales)

        * New/improved libraries:
             * New `assoc' library to represent association tables.
               (Manuel Carro, Pablo Chico)

             * New `regexp' library to handle regular expressions.
               (Manuel Carro, Pablo Chico)

             * Fixed bug in string_to_number that affected ASCII to
               floating point number conversions ( `number_codes/2'
               and bytecode read). (Jose Morales)

             * `system.pl': Added predicates `copy_file/2' and `copy_file/3'.
               Added predicates `get_uid/1', `get_gid/1', `get_pwnam/1', `get_grnam/1'
               implemented natively to get default user and groups of
               the current process. (Edison Mera)

             * Added library for mutable variables. (Remy Haemmerle)

             * Added package for block declarations (experimental).
               (Remy Haemmerle)

             * Ported CHR as a Ciao package (experimental). (Tom
               Schrijvers)

             * Debugged and improved performance of the CHR library
               port. (Remy Haemmerle)

             * `contrib/math': A library with several math functions
               that dependes on the GNU Scientific Library (GSL).
               (Edison Mera)

             * `io_aux.pl': Added `messages/1' predicate. Required to
               facilitate printing of compact messages (compatible
               with emacs). (Edison Mera)

             * Added library `hrtimer.pl' that allow us to measure
               the time using the higest resolution timer available
               in the current system. (Edison Mera)

             * Global logical (backtrackable) variables
               (experimental). (Jose Morales)

             * New dynamic handling (`dynamic_clauses' package). Not
               yet documented. (Daniel Cabeza)

             * Moved `=' from `iso_misc' to `term_basic'. (Daniel
               Cabeza)

             * `lib/lists.pl': Added predicate `sequence_to_list/2'.
               (Daniel Cabeza)

             * `lib/lists.pl': Codification of `subordlist/2'
               improved. Solutions are given in other order. (Daniel
               Cabeza)

             * `lib/filenames.pl': Added `file_directory_base_name/3'.
               (Daniel Cabeza)

             * `library/symlink_locks.pl': preliminary library to
               make locks a la emacs. (Daniel Cabeza)

             * `lib/between.pl': Bug in `between/3' fixed: when the
               low bound was a float, an smaller integer was
               generated. (Daniel Cabeza)

             * Fixed bug related to implication operator `->' in
               Fuzzy Prolog (Claudio Vaucheret)

             * `contrib/gendot': Generator of dot files, for drawing
               graphs using the dot tool. (Claudio Ochoa)

             * Addded `zeromq' library (bindings for the Zero Message
               Queue (ZeroMQ, 0MQ) cross-platform messaging
               middleware) (Dragan Ivanovic)

             * Minor documentation changes in `javall' library (Jesus
               Correas)

             * Fix a bug in calculator `pl2java' example (Jesus
               Correas)

             * `lib/aggregates.pl': Deleted duplicated clauses of `findnsols/4',
               detected by Pawel. (Daniel Cabeza)

             * Added library to transform between color spaces (HSL
               and HVS) (experimental). (Jose Morales)

             * Added module qualification in DCGs. (Remy Haemmerle,
               Jose Morales)

             * `prolog_sys:predicate_property/2' behaves similar to
               other Prolog systems (thanks to Paulo Moura for
               reporting this bug). (Jose Morales)

             * Added DHT library (implementation of distributed hash
               table) (Arsen Kostenko)

             * Adding property `intervals/2' in `native_props.pl'
               (for intervals information) (Luthfi Darmawan)

             * Added code to call polynomial root finding of GSL
               (Luthfi Darmawan)

             * Some improvements (not total, but easy to complete) to
               error messages given by errhandle.pl . Also, some of
               the errors in `sockets_c.c' are now proper exceptions
               instead of faults. (Manuel Carro)

             * `sockets' library: added a library (`nsl') needed for
               Solaris (Manuel Carro)

             * Driver, utilities, and benchmarking programs from the
               ECRC suite. These are aimed at testing some
               well-defined characteristics of a Prolog system.
               (Manuel Carro)

             * `library/getopts.pl': A module to get command-line
               options and values. Intended to be used by Ciao
               executables. (Manuel Carro)

        * Improved ISO compliance:
             * Ported the Prolog ISO conformance testing.

             * Fixed read of files containing single "`%'" char
               (reported by Ulrich Neumerkel). (Jose Morales)

             * Added exceptions in `=../2'. (Remy Haemmerle)

             * Added exceptions in arithmetic predicates. (Remy
               Haemmerle)

             * Arithmetics integer functions throw exceptions when
               used with floats. (Remy Haemmerle)

             * Added exceptions for resource errors. (Remy Haemmerle)

        * Improvements to constraint solvers:
             * Improved CLPQ documentation. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Added clp_meta/1 and clp_entailed/1 to the clpq and
               clpr packages (Samir Genaim):
                  * `clp_meta/1': meta-programming with clp
                    constraints, e.g, `clp_meta([A.>.B,B.>.1])'.

                  * `clp_entailed/1': checks if the store entails
                    specific cnstraints, e.g, `clp_entailed([A.>.B])'
                    succeeds if the current store entailes `A.>.B',
                    otherwise fails.

             * Exported the simplex predicates from CLP(Q,R). (Samir
               Genaim)

        * Other language extensions:
             * Added new `bf/bfall' package. It allows running all
               predicates in a given module in breadth-first mode
               without changing the syntax of the clauses (i.e., no
               `<-' needed). Meant basically for experimentation and,
               specially, teaching pure logic programming. (Manuel
               Hermenegildo)

             * Added `afall' package in the same line as `bf/bfall'
               (very useful!). (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Improved documentation of `bf' and `af' packages.
               (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Added partial commons-style dialect support, including
               dialect flag. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * `yap_compat' and `commons_compat' compatibility
               packages (for Yap and Prolog Commons dialects). (Jose
               Morales)

             * `argnames' package: enhanced to allow argument name
               resolution at runtime. (Jose Morales)

             * A package for conditional compilation of code (`:-
               use_package(condcomp)'). (Jose Morales)

        * Extensions for parallelism (And-Prolog):
             * Low-level support for andprolog library has been taken
               out of the engine and moved to `library/apll' in a
               similar way as the sockets library. We are planning to
               reduce the size of the actual engine further, by
               taking some components out of engine, such as locks,
               in future releases. (Amadeo Casas)

             * Improved support for deterministic parallel goals,
               including some bug fixes. (Amadeo Casas)

             * Goal stack definition added to the engine. (Amadeo
               Casas)

             * And-parallel code and the definition of goal stacks in
               the engine are now wrapped with conditionals (via
               `AND_PARALLEL_EXECUTION' variable), to avoid the
               machinery necessary to run programs in parallel
               affects in any case the sequential execution. (Amadeo
               Casas)

             * Stack expansion supported when more than one agent is
               present in the execution of parallel deterministic
               programs. This feature is still in experimental.
               Support for stack expansion in nondeterministic
               benchmarks will be added in a future release. (Amadeo
               Casas)

             * Support for stack unwinding in deterministic parallel
               programs, via `metachoice'/`metacut'. However, garbage
               collection in parallel programs is still unsupported.
               We are planning to include support for it in a future
               release. (Amadeo Casas)

             * Backward execution of nondeterministic parallel goals
               made via events, without speculation and continuation
               join. (Amadeo Casas)

             * Improved agents support. New primitives included that
               aim at increasing the flexibility of creation and
               management of agents. (Amadeo Casas)

             * Agents synchronization is done now by using locks,
               instead of using `assertz'/`retract', to improve
               efficiency in the execution of parallel programs.
               (Amadeo Casas)

             * Optimized version of `call/1' to invoke deterministic
               goals in parallel has been added
               (`call_handler_det/1'). (Amadeo Casas)

             * Optimization: locks/`new_atom' only created when the
               goal is stolen by other process, and not when this is
               pushed on to the `goal_stack'. (Amadeo Casas)

             * Integration with the new annotation algorithms
               supported by CiaoPP, both with and without
               preservation of the order of the solutions. (Amadeo
               Casas)

             * New set of examples added to the `andprolog' library.
               (Amadeo Casas)

             * Several bug fixes to remove some cases in execution of
               parallel code in which races could appear. (Amadeo
               Casas)

             * `andprolog_rt:&' by `par_rt:&' have been moved to
               `native_builtin' (Amadeo Casas)

             * `indep/1' and `indep/2' have been moved to
               `native_props', as `ground/1', `var/1', etc. (Amadeo
               Casas)

             * Added assertions to the `library/apll' and
               `library/andprolog' libraries. (Amadeo Casas)

             * Removed clauses in `pretty_print' for the `&>/2' and
               `<&/1' operators. (Amadeo Casas)

             * Shorter code for `<& / 1' and `<&! / 1' (Manuel Carro)

             * Trying to solve some problems when resetting WAM
               pointers (Manuel Carro)

             * Better code to clean the stacks (Manuel Carro)

        * Improvements to foreign (C language) interface:
             * Better support for cygwin and handling of dll
               libraries in Windows. Now usage of external dll
               libraries are supported in Windows under cygwin.
               (Edison Mera)

             * Improvements to documentation of foreign interface
               (examples). (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Allow reentrant calls from Prolog to C and then from C
               to Prolog. (Jose Morales)

             * Fix bug that prevented `ciaoc -c MODULE' from
               generating dynamic `.so' libraries files. (Jose
               Morales)

             * Fix bug that prevented `ciaoc MODULE && rm MODULE &&
               ciaoc MODULE' from emitting correct executables
               (previously, dynamic `.so' libraries files where
               ignored in executable recompilations when only the
               main file was missing). (Jose Morales)

        * Run-Time Checking and Unit Tests:
             * Added support to perfom run-time checking of
               assertions and predicates outside `ciaopp' (see the
               documentation for more details). In addition to those
               already available, the new properties that can be
               run-time checked are: `exception/1', `exception/2',
               `no_exception/1', `no_exception/2', `user_output/2',
               `solutions/2', `num_solutions/2', `no_signal/1',
               `no_signal/2', `signal/1', `signal/2', `signals/2',
               `throws/2'. See library `assertions/native_props.pl'
               (Edison Mera)

             * Added support for testing via the `unittest' library.
               Documentation available at
               `library(unittest(unittest_doc))'. (Edison Mera)

        * Profiling:
             * Improved profiler, now it is cost center-based and
               works together with the run-time checking machinery in
               order to also validate execution time-related
               properties. (Edison Mera)

             * A tool for automatic bottleneck detection has been
               developed, which is able to point at the predicates
               responsible of lack of performance in a program.
               (Edison Mera)

             * Improved profiler documentation. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

        * Debugger enhancements:
             * Added the flag `check_cycles' to control whether the
               debugger takes care of cyclic terms while displaying
               goals. The rationale is that to check for cyclic terms
               may lead to very high response times when having big
               terms. By default the flag is in off, which implies
               that a cyclic term in the execution could cause
               infinite loops (but otherwise the debugger is much
               more speedy). (Daniel Cabeza)

             * Show the variable names instead of underscores with
               numbers. Added option `v' to show the variables list.
               Added `v <N>' option, where `N' is the `Name' of the
               variable you like to watch (experimental). (Edison
               Mera)

             * Distinguish between program variables and
               compiler-introduced variables. Show variables modified
               in the current goal. (Edison Mera)

             * `debug_mode' does not leave useless choicepoints (Jose
               Morales)

        * Emacs mode:
             * Made ciao mode NOT ask by default if one wants to set
               up version control when first saving a file. This
               makes more sense if using other version control
               systems and probably in any case (several users had
               asked for this). There is a global customizable
               variable (which appears in the LPdoc area) which can
               be set to revert to the old behaviour. Updated the
               manual accordingly. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Added possibility of chosing which emacs Ciao should
               use during compilation, by LPdoc, etc. Previously only
               a default emacs was used which is not always the right
               thing, specially, e.g., in Mac OS X, where the
               latest/right emacs may not even be in the paths. Other
               minor typos etc. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Moved the version control menu entries to the LPdoc
               menu. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Updated highlighting for new functional syntax, unit
               tests, and all other new features. (Manuel
               Hermenegildo)

             * Completed CiaoPP-java environment (menus, buttons,
               etc.) and automated loading when visiting Java files
               (still through hand modification of .emacs). CiaoPP
               help (e.g., for properties) now also available in Java
               mode. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Changes to graphical interface to adapt better to
               current functionality of CiaoPP option browser. Also
               some minor aesthetic changes. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Various changes and fixes to adapt to emacs-22/23
               lisp. In particular, fixed cursor error in emacs 23 in
               Ciao shell (from Emilio Gallego). Also fixed prompt in
               ciaopp and LPdoc buffers for emacs 23. (Manuel
               Hermenegildo)

             * Unified several versions of the Ciao emacs mode
               (including the one with the experimental toolbar in
               xemacs) that had diverged. Sorely needed to be able to
               make progress without duplication. (Manuel
               Hermenegildo)

             * New version of ciao.el supporting tool bar in xemacs
               and also, and perhaps more importantly, in newer
               emacsen (>= 22), where it previously did not work
               either. New icons with opaque background for xemacs
               tool bar. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Using `key-description' instead of a combination of
               `text-char-description' and `string-to-char'. This
               fixes a bug in the Ciao Emacs Mode when running in
               emacs 23, that shows wrong descriptions for `M-...'
               key bindings. The new code runs correctly in emacs 21
               and 22. (Jose Morales)

             * Coloring strings before functional calls and `0''
               characters (strings like `"~w"' were colored
               incorrectly) (Jose Morales)

             * `@begin{verbatim}' and `@include' colored as LPdoc
               commands only inside LPdoc comments. (Jose Morales)

             * Fixed colors for dark backgrounds (workaround to avoid
               a bug in emacs) (Jose Morales)

             * Added an automatic indenter (contrib/plindent) and
               formatting tool, under emacs you can invoque it using
               the keyword `C-c I' in the current buffer containing
               your prolog source. (Edison Mera)

        * Packaging and distribution:
             * User-friendly, binary installers for several systems
               are now generated regularly and automatically:
               Ubuntu/Debian, Fedora/RedHat, Windows (XP, Vista, 7)
               and MacOSX. (Edison Mera, Remy Haemmerle)

        * Improvements in Ciao toplevel:
             * Introduced `check_cycles' `prolog_flag' which controls
               whether the toplevel handles or not cyclic terms. Flag
               is set to false by default (cycles not detected and
               handled) in order to speed up responses. (Daniel
               Cabeza)

             * Modified `valid_solution/2' so that it asks no
               question when there are no pending choice points and
               the `prompt_alternatives_no_bindings' prolog flag is
               on. (Jose Morales)

             * Now 'Y' can be used as well as 'y' to accept a
               solution of a query. (Daniel Cabeza)

             * Added newline before `true' when displaying empty
               solutions. (Jose Morales)

             * Multifile declarations of packages used by the
               toplevel were not properly handled. Fixed. (Daniel
               Cabeza)

             * Fixed bug in output of bindings when current output
               changed.

             * Changes so that including files in the toplevel (or
               loading packages) does not invoke an expansion of the
               ending end_of_file. This makes sense because the
               toplevel code is never completed, and thus no cleanup
               code of translations is invoked. (Daniel Cabeza)

        * Compiler enhancements and bug fixes:
             * Added a command line option to `ciaoc' for generating
               code with runtime checks. (Daniel Cabeza)

             * Now the compiler reads assertions by default (when
               using the assertion package), and verifies their
               syntax. (Edison Mera)

             * Added option `-w' to `ciaoc' compiler to generate the
               WAM code of the specified prolog files. (Edison Mera)

             * Fixed bug in exemaker: now when `main/0' and `main/1'
               exists, `main/0' is always the program entry (before
               in modules either could be). (Daniel Cabeza)

             * Fixed bug: when compiling a file, if an imported file
               had no itf and it used the redefining declaration, the
               declaration was forgotten between the reading of the
               imported file (to get its interface) and its later
               compilation. By now those declarations are never
               forgotten, but perhaps it could be done better.
               (Daniel Cabeza)

             * The unloading of files kept some data related to them,
               which caused in some cases errors or warnings
               regarding module redefinitions. Now this is fixed.
               (Daniel Cabeza)

             * Undefined predicate warnings also for predicate calls
               qualified with current module (bug detected by Pawel
               Pietrzak). (Daniel Cabeza)

             * Fixed bug `debugger_include' (that is, now a change in
               a file included from a module which is debugged is
               detected when the module is reloaded). (Daniel Cabeza)

             * Fixed `a(B) :- _=B, b, c(B)' bug in compilation of
               unification. (Jose Morales)

        * Improving general support for language extensions:
             * Every package starts with '`:- package(...)''
               declaration now. This allows a clear distinction
               between packages, modules, and files that are just
               included; all of them using the same `.pl' extension.
               (Jose Morales)

             * Added priority in syntax translations. Users are not
               required to know the details of translations in order
               to use them (experimental: the the correct order for
               all the Ciao packages is still not fixed) (Jose
               Morales)

             * Now the initialization of sentence translations is
               done in the translation package, when they are added.
               In this way, previous active translations cannot
               affect the initialization of new translations, and
               initializations are not started each time a new
               sentence translation is added. Additionally, now the
               initialization of sentence translations in the
               toplevel is done (there was a bug). (Daniel Cabeza)

             * Added `addterm(Meta)' meta-data specification for the
               implementation of the changes to provide a correct `clause/2'
               predicate. (Daniel Cabeza)

             * Generalized `addmodule' meta-data specification to
               `addmodule(Meta)', `addmodule' is now an alias for
               `addmodule(?)'. Needed for the implementation of the
               changes to provide a correct `clause/2' predicate.
               (Daniel Cabeza)

        * Improvements to system assertions:
             * Added regtype `basic_props:num_code/1' and more
               assertions to `basic_props.pl' (German Puebla)

             * Added trust assertion for `atomic_basic:number_codes/2'
               in order to have more accurate analysis info (first
               argument a number and second argument is a list of
               num_codes) (German Puebla)

             * Added some more binding insensitivity assertions in
               `basic_props.pl' (German Puebla)

             * Added the `basic_props:filter/2' property which is
               used at the global control level in order to guarantee
               termination. (German Puebla)

             * Added `equiv' assertion for `basiccontrol:fail/0'
               (German Puebla)

             * Modified eval assertion so that partial evaluation
               does not loop with ill-typed, semi-instantiated calls
               to `is/2' (this problem was reported some time ago)
               (German Puebla)

             * Replaced `true' assertions for arithmetic predicates
               with `trust' assertions (`arithmetic.pl'). (German
               Puebla)

             * Added assertions for `term_basic:'='/2' (the _not
               unification_) (German Puebla)

             * Added assertions for `lists:nth/3' predicate and `lists:reverse/3'.
               (German Puebla)

             * Changed calls to `atom/1' to `atm/1' in `c_itf_props:moddesc/1'
               (it is a regular type) (Jesus Correas)

             * `formulae:assert_body_type/1' switched to `prop', it
               is not a `regtype'. (Jesus Correas)

             * Added assertions to `atom_concat/2'. (Jesus Correas)

             * Added some assertions to `dec10_io', `lists',
               `strings' libraries. (Jesus Correas)

             * Removed `check' from pred and success froom many
               library assertions. (Jesus Correas)

             * Fixed a problem when reading multiple disjunction in
               assertions (`library/formulae.pl' and
               `lib/assertions/assrt_write.pl'). (Pawel Pietrzak)

             * Added/improved assertions in several modules under
               `lib/' (Pawel Pietrzak)

        * Engine enhancements:
             * Added support for Ciao compilation in `ppc64'
               architecture. (Manuel Carro)

             * `sun4v' added in `ciao_get_arch'. (Amadeo Casas)

             * Solved compilation issue in Sparc. (Manuel Carro,
               Amadeo Casas)

             * Support for 64 bits Intel processor (in 32-bit
               compatibility mode). (Manuel Carro)

             * Switched the default memory manager from linear to the
               binary tree version (which improves management of
               small memory blocks). (Remy Haemmerle)

             * Using `mmap' in Linux/i86, Linux/Sparc and Mac OS X
               (Manuel Carro)

             * A rename of the macro `REGISTER' to `CIAO_REGISTER'.
               There have been reports of the macro name clashing
               with an equally-named one in third-party packages
               (namely, the PPL library). (Manuel Carro)

             * A set of macros `CIAO_REG_n' (`n' currently goes from
               `1' to `4', but it can be enlarged) to force the GCC
               compiler to store a variable in a register. This
               includes assignments of hardware registers for `n = 1'
               to `3', in seemingly ascending order of effectiveness.
               See coments in registers.h (Manuel Carro)

             * An assignement of (local) variables to be definitely
               stored in registers for some (not all) functions in
               the engine - notably `wam.c'. These were decided
               making profiling of C code to find out bottlenecks and
               many test runs with different assignments of C
               variables to registers. (Manuel Carro)

             * Changed symbol name to avoid clashes with other
               third-party packages (such as minisat). (Manuel Carro)

             * Fixed a memory alignment problem (for RISC
               architectures where words must be word-aligned, like
               Sparc). (Jose Morales)

             * Unifying some internal names (towards merge with
               optim_comp experimental branch). (Jose Morales)

        * Attributed variables:
             * Attributes of variables are correctly displayed in the
               toplevel even if they contain cyclic terms. Equations
               added in order to define cyclic terms in attributes
               are output after the attributes, and do use always new
               variable names (doing otherwise was very involved).
               (Daniel Cabeza)

             * `lib/attrdump.pl': The library now works for infinite
               (cyclic) terms. (Daniel Cabeza)

             * Changed multifile predicate `dump/3' to `dump_constraints/3'.
               (Daniel Cabeza)

             * Added `copy_extract_attr_nc/3' which is a faster
               version of `copy_extract_attr/3' but does not handle
               cyclic terms properly. (Daniel Cabeza)

             * Added `term_basic:copy_term_nat/2' to copy a term
               taking out attributes. (Daniel Cabeza)

        * Documentation:
             * Added `deprecated/1'. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Improvements to documentation of `rtchecks' and tests.
               (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Many updates to manuals: dates, copyrights, etc. Some
               text updates also. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Fixed all manual generation errors reported by LPdoc
               (still a number of warnings and notes left). (Manuel
               Hermenegildo)

             * Adding some structure (minor) to all manuals (Ciao,
               LPdoc, CiaoPP) using new LPdoc `doc_structure/1'.
               (Jose Morales)

        * Ciao Website:
             * Redesigned the Ciao website. It is generated again
               through LPdoc, but with new approach. (Jose Morales)

*Version 1.13 (2005/7/3, 19:5:53 CEST)*
     New development version after 1.12. (Jose Morales)

*Version 1.12 (2005/7/3, 18:50:50 CEST)*
     Temporary version before transition to SVN. (Jose Morales)

*Version 1.11#1 (2003/4/4, 18:30:31 CEST)*
     New development version to begin the builtin modularization
     (Jose Morales)

*Version 1.10 (2004/7/29, 16:12:3 CEST)*
        * Classical prolog mode as default behavior.

        * Emacs-based environment improved.
             * Improved emacs inferior (interaction) mode for Ciao
               and CiaoPP.

             * Xemacs compatibility improved (thanks to A. Rigo).

             * New icons and modifications in the environment for the
               preprocessor.

             * Icons now installed in a separate dir.

             * Compatibility with newer versions of `Cygwin'.

             * Changes to programming environment:
                  * Double-click startup of programming environment.

                  * Reorganized menus: help and customization grouped
                    in separate menus.

                  * Error location extended.

                  * Automatic/Manual location of errors produced when
                    running Ciao tools now customizable.

                  * Presentation of CiaoPP preprocessor output
                    improved.

             * Faces and coloring improved:
                  * Faces for syntax-based highlighting more
                    customizable.

                  * Syntax-based coloring greatly improved.
                    Literal-level assertions also correctly colored
                    now.

                  * Syntax-based coloring now also working on ASCII
                    terminals (for newer versions of emacs).

                  * Listing user-defined directives allowed to be
                    colored in special face.

                  * Syntax errors now colored also in inferior
                    buffers.

                  * Customizable faces now appear in the
                    documentation.

                  * Added new tool bar button (and binding) to
                    refontify block/buffer.

                  * Error marks now cleared automatically also when
                    generating docs.

                  * Added some fixes to hooks in lpdoc buffer.

        * Bug fixes in compiler.
             * Replication of clauses in some cases (thanks to S.
               Craig).

        * Improvements related to supported platforms
             * Compilation and installation in different palatforms
               have been improved.

             * New Mac OS X kernels supported.

        * Improvement and bugs fixes in the engine:
             * Got rid of several segmentation violation problems.

             * Number of significant decimal digits to be printed now
               computed accurately.

             * Added support to test conversion of a Ciao integer
               into a machine int.

             * Unbound length atoms now always working.

             * C interface .h files reachable through a more standard
               location (thanks to R. Bagnara).

             * Compatibility with newer versions of gcc.

        * New libraries and utilities added to the system:
             * Factsdb: facts defined in external files can now be
               automatically cached on-demand.

             * Symfnames: File aliasing to internal streams added.

        * New libraries added (in beta state):
             * fd: clp(FD)

             * xml_path: XML querying and transformation to Prolog.

             * xdr_handle: XDR schema to HTML forms utility.

             * ddlist: Two-way traversal list library.

             * gnuplot: Interface to GnuPlot.

             * time_analyzer: Execution time profiling.

        * Some libraries greatly improved:
             * Interface to Tcl/Tk very improved.
                  * Corrected many bugs in both interaction Prolog to
                    Tcl/Tk and viceversa.

                  * Execution of Prolog goals from TclTk revamped.

                  * Treatment of Tcl events corrected.

                  * Predicate `tcl_eval/3' now allows the execution
                    of Tcl procedures running multiple Prolog goals.

                  * Documentation heavily reworked.

                  * Fixed unification of prolog goals run from the
                    Tcl side.

             * Pillow library improved in many senses.
                  * HTTP media type parameter values returned are
                    always strings now, not atoms.

                  * Changed verbatim() pillow term so that newlines
                    are translated to <br>.

                  * Changed management of cookies so that special
                    characters in values are correctly handled.

                  * Added predicate `url_query_values/2', reversible.
                    Predicate `url_query/2' now obsolete.

                  * Now attribute values in tags are escaped to
                    handle values which have double quotes.

                  * Improved `get_form_input/1' and `url_query/2' so
                    that names of parameters having unusual
                    characters are always correctly handled.

             * Fixed bug in tokenizer regarding non-terminated single
               or multiple-line comments. When the last line of a
               file has a single-line comment and does not end in a
               newline, it is accepted as correct. When an
               open-comment /* sequence is not terminated in a file,
               a syntax error exception is thrown.

        * Other libraries improved:
             * Added native_props to assertions package and included `nonground/1'.

             * In atom2terms, changed interpretation of double quoted
               strings so that they are not parsed to terms.

             * Control on exceptions improved.

             * Added `native/1,2' to basic_props.

             * Davinci error processing improved.

             * Foreign predicates are now automatically declared as
               implementation-defined.

             * In lists, added `cross_product/2' to compute the
               cartesian product of a list of lists. Also added `delete_non_ground/3',
               enabling deletion of nonground terms from a list.

             * In llists added `transpose/2' and changed `append/2'
               implementation with a much more efficient code.

             * The make library has been improved.

             * In persdb, added `pretractall_fact/1' and `retractall_fact/1'
               as persdb native capabilities.

             * Improved behavior with user environment from persdb.

             * In persdb, added support for `persistent_dir/4', which
               includes arguments to specify permission modes for
               persistent directory and files.

             * Some minor updates in persdb_sql.

             * Added treatment of operators and module:pred calls to
               pretty-printer.

             * Updated report of read of syntax errors.

             * File locking capabilities included in `open/3'.

             * Several improvements in library system.

             * New input/output facilities added to sockets.

             * Added `most_specific_generalization/3' and `most_general_instance/3'
               to terms_check.

             * Added `sort_dict/2' to library vndict.

             * The xref library now treats also empty references.

        * Miscellaneous updates:
             * Extended documentation in libraries actmods, arrays,
               foreign_interface, javall, persdb_mysql, prolog_sys,
               old_database, and terms_vars.

*Version 1.9 (2002/5/16, 23:17:34 CEST)*
     New development version after stable 1.8p0 (MCL, DCG)

*Version 1.8 (2002/5/16, 21:20:27 CEST)*
        * Improvements related to supported platforms:
             * Support for Mac OS X 10.1, based on the Darwin kernel.

             * Initial support for compilation on Linux for Power PC
               (contributed by Paulo Moura).

             * Workaround for incorrect C compilation while using
               newer (> 2.95) gcc compilers.

             * .bat files generated in Windows.

        * Changes in compiler behavior and user interface:
             * Corrected a bug which caused wrong code generation in
               some cases.

             * Changed execution of initialization directives. Now
               the initialization of a module/file never runs before
               the initializations of the modules from which the
               module/file imports (excluding circular dependences).

             * The engine is more intelligent when looking for an
               engine to execute bytecode; this caters for a variety
               of situations when setting explicitly the CIAOLIB
               environment variable.

             * Fixed bugs in the toplevel: behaviour of `module:main'
               calls and initialization of a module (now happens
               after related modules are loaded).

             * Layout char not needed any more to end Prolog files.

             * Syntax errors now disable .itf creation, so that they
               show next time the code is used without change.

             * Redefinition warnings now issued only when an
               unqualified call is seen.

             * Context menu in Windows can now load a file into the
               toplevel.

             * Updated Windows installation in order to run CGI
               executables under Windows: a new information item is
               added to the registry.

             * Added new directories found in recent Linux
               distributions to INFOPATH.

             * Emacs-based environment and debugger improved:
                  * Errors located immediataly after code loading.

                  * Improved ciao-check-types-modes (preprocessor
                    progress now visible).

                  * Fixed loading regions repeatedly (no more
                    predicate redefinition warnings).

                  * Added entries in `ciaopp' menu to set verbosity
                    of output.

                  * Fixed some additional xemacs compatibility issues
                    (related to searches).

                  * Errors reported by inferior processes are now
                    explored in forward order (i.e., the first error
                    rewported is the first one highlighted). Improved
                    tracking of errors.

                  * Specific tool bar now available, with icons for
                    main fuctions (works from emacs 21.1 on). Also,
                    other minor adaptations for working with emacs
                    21.1 and later.

                  * Debugger faces are now locally defined (and
                    better customization). This also improves
                    comtability with xemacs (which has different
                    faces).

                  * Direct access to a common use of the preprocessor
                    (checking modes/types and locating errors) from
                    toolbar.

                  * Inferior modes for Ciao and CiaoPP improved:
                    contextual help turned on by default.

                  * Fixes to set-query. Also, previous query now
                    appears in prompt.

                  * Improved behaviour of stored query.

                  * Improved behaviour of recentering, finding
                    errors, etc.

                  * Wait for prompt has better termination
                    characteristics.

                  * Added new interactive entry points (M-x): ciao,
                    prolog, ciaopp.

                  * Better tracking of last inferior buffer used.

                  * Miscellanous bugs removed; some colors changed to
                    adapt to different Emacs versions.

                  * Fixed some remaining incompatibilities with
                    xemacs.

                  * `:- doc' now also supported and highlighted.

                  * Eliminated need for calendar.el

                  * Added some missing library directives to fontlock
                    list, organized this better.

        * New libraries added to the system:
             * hiord: new library which needs to be loaded in order
               to use higher-order call/N and P(X) syntax. Improved
               model for predicate abstractions.

             * fuzzy: allows representing fuzzy information in the
               form or Prolog rules.

             * use_url: allows loading a module remotely by using a
               WWW address of the module source code

             * andorra: alternative search method where goals which
               become deterministic at run time are executed before
               others.

             * iterative deepening (id): alternative search method
               which makes a depth-first search until a predetermined
               depth is reached. Complete but in general cheaper than
               breadth first.

             * det_hook: allows making actions when a deterministic
               situation is reached.

             * ProVRML: read VRML code and translate it into Prolog
               terms, and the other way around.

             * io_alias_redirection: change where stdin/stdout/stderr
               point to from within Ciao programs.

             * tcl_tk: an interface to Tcl/Tk programs.

             * tcl_tk_obj: object-based interface to Tcl/Tk graphical
               objects.

             * CiaoPP: options to interface with the CiaoPP Prolog
               preprocessor.

        * Some libraries greatly improved:
             * WebDB: utilities to create WWW-based database
               interfaces.

             * Improved java interface implementation (this forced
               renaming some interface primitives).

             * User-transparent persistent predicate database
               revamped:
                  * Implemented passerta_fact/1 (asserta_fact/1).

                  * Now it is never necessary to explicitly call
                    init_persdb, a call to initialize_db is only
                    needed after dynamically defining facts of
                    persistent_dir/2. Thus, pcurrent_fact/1 predicate
                    eliminated.

                  * Facts of persistent predicates included in the
                    program code are now included in the persistent
                    database when it is created. They are ignored in
                    successive executions.

                  * Files where persistent predicates reside are now
                    created inside a directory named as the module
                    where the persistent predicates are defined, and
                    are named as F_A* for predicate F/A.

                  * Now there are two packages: persdb and
                    'persdb/ll' (for low level). In the first, the
                    standard builtins asserta_fact/1, assertz_fact/1,
                    and retract_fact/1 are replaced by new versions
                    which handle persistent data predicates, behaving
                    as usual for normal data predicates. In the
                    second package, predicates with names starting
                    with 'p' are defined, so that there is not
                    overhead in calling the standard builtins.

                  * Needed declarations for persistent_dir/2 are now
                    included in the packages.

             * SQL now works with mysql.

             * system: expanded to contain more predicates which act
               as interface to the underlying system / operating
               system.

        * Other libraries improved:
             * xref: creates cross-references among Prolog files.

             * concurrency: new predicates to create new concurrent
               predicates on-the-fly.

             * sockets: bugs corrected.

             * objects: concurrent facts now properly recognized.

             * fast read/write: bugs corrected.

             * Added 'webbased' protocol for active modules:
               publication of active module address can now be made
               through WWW.

             * Predicates in library(dynmods) moved to
               library(compiler).

             * Expansion and meta predicates improved.

             * Pretty printing.

             * Assertion processing.

             * Module-qualified function calls expansion improved.

             * Module expansion calls goal expansion even at runtime.

        * Updates to builtins (there are a few more; these are the
          most relevant):

             * Added a prolog_flag to retrieve the version and patch.

             * current_predicate/1 in library(dynamic) now enumerates
               non-engine modules, prolog_sys:current_predicate/2 no
               longer exists.

             * exec/* bug fixed.

             * srandom/1 bug fixed.

        * Updates for C interface:
             * Fixed bugs in already existing code.

             * Added support for creation and traversing of Prolog
               data structures from C predicates.

             * Added support for raising Prolog exceptions from C
               predicates.

             * Preliminary support for calling Prolog from C.

        * Miscellaneous updates:
             * Installation made more robust.

             * Some pending documentation added.

             * 'ciao' script now adds (locally) to path the place
               where it has been installed, so that other programs
               can be located without being explicitly in the $PATH.

             * Loading programs is somewhat faster now.

             * Some improvement in printing path names in Windows.

2 Getting started on Un*x-like machines
***************************************

*Author(s):* Manuel Hermenegildo.

   This part guides you through some very basic first steps with Ciao
on a Un*x-like system. It assumes that Ciao is already installed
correctly on your Un*x system. If this is not the case, then follow
the instructions in *note Installing Ciao from the source
distribution:: first.

   We start with by describing the basics of using Ciao from a normal
command shell such as `sh/bash', `csh/tcsh', etc. We strongly
recommend reading also *note An introduction to the Ciao emacs
environment (Un*x):: for the basics on using Ciao under `emacs',
which is a much simpler and much more powerful way of developing Ciao
programs, and has the advantage of offering an almost identical
environment under Un*x and Windows.

2.1 Testing your Ciao Un*x installation
=======================================

It is a good idea to start by performing some tests to check that
Ciao is installed correctly on your system (these are the same tests
that you are instructed to do during installation, so you can
obviously skip them if you have done them already at that time). If
any of these tests do not succeed either your environment variables
are not set properly (see *note Un*x user setup:: for how to fix
this):

   * Typing `ciao' (or `ciaosh') should start the typical
     Prolog-style top-level shell.

   * In the top-level shell, Ciao library modules should load
     correctly. Type for example `use_module(library(dec10_io))' -you
     should get back a prompt with no errors reported.

   * To exit the top level shell, type `halt.' as usual, or <^D>.

   * Typing `ciaoc' should produce the help message from the Ciao standalone
     compiler.

   * Typing `ciao-shell' should produce a message saying that no code
     was found. This is a Ciao application which can be used to write scripts
     written in Ciao, i.e., files which do not need any explicit
     compilation to be run.


Also, the following documentation-related actions should work:

   * If the `info' program is installed, typing `info' should produce
     a list of manuals which _should include Ciao manual(s) in a
     separate area_ (you may need to log out and back in so that your
     shell variables are reinitialized for this to work).

   * Opening with a WWW browser (e.g., `netscape') the directory or
     `URL' corresponding to the `DOCDIR' setting should show a series
     of Ciao-related manuals. Note that _style sheets_ should be
     activated for correct formatting of the manual.

   * Typing `man ciao' should produce a man page with some very basic
     general information on Ciao (and pointing to the on-line
     manuals).

   * The `DOCDIR' directory should contain the manual also in the
     other formats such as `postscript' or `pdf' which specially
     useful for printing. See *note Printing manuals (Un*x):: for
     instructions.

2.2 Un*x user setup
===================

If the tests above have succeeded, the system is probably installed
correctly and your environment variables have been set already. In
that case you can skip to the next section.

   Otherwise, if you have not already done so, make the following
modifications in your startup scripts, so that these files are used
(`<LIBROOT>' must be replaced with the appropriate value, i.e., where
the Ciao library is installed):

   * For users a _csh-compatible shell_ ( `csh', `tcsh', ...), add to `~/.cshrc':

                  if ( -e <v>libroot</v>/ciao/DOTcshrc ) then
                     source <v>libroot</v>/ciao/DOTcshrc
                  endif

     *Note*: while this is recognized by the terminal shell, and
     therefore by the text-mode Emacs which comes with Mac OS X, the
     Aqua native Emacs 21 does not recognize that initialization. It
     is thus necessary, at this moment, to set manually the Ciao
     shell (ciaosh) and Ciao library location by hand. This can be
     done from the Ciao menu within Emacs after a Ciao file has been
     loaded. We believe that the reason is that Mac OS X does not
     actually consult the per-user initialization files on startup.
     It should also be possible to put the right initializations in
     the .emacs file using the `setenv' function of Emacs-lisp, as in

          (setenv "CIAOLIB" "<v>libroot</v>/ciao")

     The same can be done for the rest of the variables initialized
     in `<v>libroot</v>/ciao/DOTcshrc'

   * For users of an _sh-compatible shell_ ( `sh', `bash', ...), the
     installer will add to `~/.bashrc' the next lines:

                  if [ -f <v>libroot</v>/ciao/DOTprofile ]; then
                     . <v>libroot</v>/ciao/DOTprofile
                  fi

     This will set up things so that the Ciao executables are found
     and you can access the Ciao system manuals using the `info'
     command. Note that, depending on your shell, _you may have to
     log out and back in_ for the changes to take effect.

   * Also, if you use `emacs' (highly recommended) the install will
     add the next line to your `~/.emacs' file:

                  (load-file "<v>libroot</v>/ciao/ciao-mode-init.el")
                  (if (file-exists-p "<v>libroot</v>/ciao/ciao-mode-init.el")
                    (load-file "<v>libroot</v>/ciao/ciao-mode-init.el")
                  )


   If after following these steps things do not work properly, then

2.3.1 Starting/exiting the top-level shell (Un*x)
-------------------------------------------------

The basic methods for starting/exiting the top-level shell have been
discussed above. If upon typing `ciao' you get a "command not found"
error or you get a longer message from Ciao before starting, it means
that either Ciao was not installed correctly or you environment
variables are not set up properly. Follow the instructions on the
message printed by Ciao or refer to the installation instructions
regarding user-setup for details.

2.3.2 Getting help (Un*x)
-------------------------

The basic methods for accessing the manual on-line have also been
discussed above. Use the table of contents and the indices of
_predicates_, _libraries_, _concepts_, etc. to find what you are
looking for.  Context-sensitive help is available within the `emacs'
environment (see below).


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Compiling and running programs (Un*x),  Next: Generating executables (Un*x),  Prev: Getting help (Un*x),  Up: Using Ciao from a Un*x command shell

2.3.3 Compiling and running programs (Un*x)
-------------------------------------------

Once the shell is started, you can compile and execute modules inside
the interactive top-level shell in the standard way. E.g., type
`use_module(_file_).', `use_module(library(_file_)).' for library
modules, `ensure_loaded(_file_).' for files which are not modules,
and `use_package(_file_).' for library packages (these are
syntactic/semantic packages that extend the Ciao language in many
different ways). Note that the use of `compile/1' and `consult/1' is
discouraged in Ciao.

   For example, you may want to type `use_package(iso)' to ensure
Ciao has loaded all the ISO builtins (whether this is done by default
or not depends on your `.ciaorc' file). Do not worry about any
"module already in executable" messages -these are normal and simply
mean that a certain module is already pre-loaded in the top-level
shell. At this point, typing `write(hello).' should work.

   Note that some predicates that may be built-ins in typical Prolog
implementations are available through libraries in Ciao. This
facilitates making small executables.

   To change the working directory to, say, the `examples' directory
in the Ciao root directory, first do:

           ?- use_module(library(system)).

(loading the `system' library makes a number of system-related
predicates such as `cd/1' accessible) and then:

           ?- cd('$/examples').

(in Ciao the sequence `$/' _at the beginning of a path name_ is
replaced by the path of the Ciao root directory).

   For more information see *note The interactive top-level shell::.

2.3.4 Generating executables (Un*x)
-----------------------------------

Executables can be generated from the top-level shell (using `make_exec/2')
or using the standalone compiler ( `ciaoc'). To be able to make an
executable, the file should define the predicate `main/1' (or `main/0'),
which will be called upon startup (see the corresponding manual
section for details). In its simplest use, given a top-level
_foo_`.pl' file for an application, the compilation process produces
an executable `foo', automatically detecting which other files used
by `foo.pl' need recompilation.

For example, within the `examples' directory, you can type:

         ?- make_exec(hw,_).

which should produce an executable. Typing `hw' in a shell (or
double-clicking on the icon from a graphical window) should execute
it.

   For more information see *note The interactive top-level shell::
and *note The stand-alone command-line compiler::.

2.3.5 Running Ciao scripts (Un*x)
---------------------------------

Ciao allows writing scripts. These are files containing Ciao source
but which get executed without having to explicitly compile them (in
the same way as, e.g., `.bat' files or programs in scripting
languages). As an example, you can run the file `hw' in the `examples'
directory of the Ciao distribution and look at the source with an
editor. You can try changing the `Hello world' message and running
the program again (no need to recompile!).

   As you can see, the file should define the predicate `main/1' (not `main/0'),
which will be called upon startup. The two header lines are necessary
in Un*x in. In Windows you can leave them in or you can take them
out, but you need to rename the script to `hw.pls'. Leaving the lines
in has the advantage that the script will also work in Un*x without
any change.

   For more information see *note The script interpreter::.

2.3.6 The Ciao initialization file (Un*x)
-----------------------------------------

The Ciao toplevel can be made to execute upon startup a number of
commands (such as, e.g., loading certain files or setting certain
Ciao flags) contained in an initialization file. This file should be
called `.ciaorc' and placed in your _home_ directory (e.g., `~', the
same in which the `.emacs' file is put). You may need to set the
environment variable `HOME' to the path of this directory for the
Ciao toplevel shell to be able to locate this file on startup.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Printing manuals (Un*x),  Prev: The Ciao initialization file (Un*x),  Up: Using Ciao from a Un*x command shell

2.3.7 Printing manuals (Un*x)
-----------------------------

As mentioned before, the manual is available in several formats in
the `reference' directory within the `doc' directory in the Ciao
distribution, including `postscript' or `pdf', which are specially
useful for printing. These files are also available in the `DOCDIR'
directory specified during installation. Printing can be done using
an application such as `ghostview' (freely available from
`http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html') or `acrobat reader'
(`http://www.adobe.com', only `pdf').

2.4 An introduction to the Ciao emacs environment (Un*x)
========================================================

While it is easy to use Ciao with any editor of your choice, using it
within the `emacs' editor/program development system is highly
recommended: Ciao includes an `emacs' _mode_ which provides a very
complete _application development environment_ which greatly
simplifies many program development tasks. See *note Using Ciao
inside GNU emacs:: for details on the capabilities of `ciao'/ `emacs'
combination.

   If the (freely available) `emacs' editor/environment is not
installed in your system, we highly recommend that you also install
it at this point (there are instructions for where to find `emacs'
and how to install it in the Ciao installation instructions). After
having done this you can try for example the following things:

   * A few basic things:

        * Typing <^H> <i> (or in the menus `Help->Manuals->Browse
          Manuals with Info') should open a list of manuals in info
          format in which the Ciao manual(s) should appear.

        * When opening a Ciao file, i.e., a file with `.pl' or `.pls'
          ending, using <^X><^F>`filename' (or using the menus) the
          code should appear highlighted according to syntax (e.g.,
          comments in red), and `Ciao/Prolog' menus should appear in
          the menu bar on top of the `emacs' window.

        * Loading the file using the `Ciao/Prolog' menu (or typing
          <^C> <l>) should start in another emacs buffer the Ciao
          toplevel shell and load the file. You should now be able to
          switch the the toplevel shell and make queries from within `emacs'.


     *Note*: when using `emacs' it is _very convenient_ to swap the
     locations of the (normally not very useful) <Caps Lock> key and
     the (very useful in `emacs') <Ctrl> key on the keyboard. How to
     do this is explained in the `emacs' frequently asked questions
     FAQs (see the `emacs' download instructions for their location).

     (if these things do not work the system or emacs may not be
     installed properly).

   * You can go to the location of most of the errors that may be
     reported during compilation by typing <^C> <`>.

   * You can also, e.g., create executables from the `Ciao/Prolog'
     menu, as well as compile individual files, or generate active
     modules.

   * Loading a file for source-level debugging using the
     `Ciao/Prolog' menu (or typing <^C> <d>) and then issuing a query
     should start the source-level debugger and move a marker on the
     code in a window while execution is stepped through in the
     window running the Ciao top level.

   * You can add the lines needed in Un*x for turning any file
     defining `main/1' into a script from the Ciao/Prolog menu or by
     typing <^C> <I> <S>.

   * You can also work with the preprocessor and auto-documenter
     directly from emacs: see their manuals or browse through the
     corresponding menus that appear when editing `.pl' files.

emacs:: to discover the many other functionalities of this
environment.

3 Getting started on Windows machines
*************************************

*Author(s):* Manuel Hermenegildo.

   This part guides you through some very basic first steps with Ciao
on an MSWindows ("Win32") system. It assumes that Ciao is already
installed correctly on your Windows system. If this is not the case,
then follow the instructions in *note Installing Ciao from a Win32
binary distribution:: (or *note Installing Ciao from the source
distribution::) first.

   We start with by describing the basics of using Ciao from the
Windows explorer and/or a DOS command shell. We strongly recommend
reading also *note An introduction to the Ciao emacs environment
(Win32):: for the basics on using Ciao under `emacs', which is a much
simpler and much more powerful way of developing Ciao programs, and
has the advantage of offering an almost identical environment under
Windows and Un*x.

3.1 Testing your Ciao Win32 installation
========================================

It is a good idea to start by performing some tests to check that
Ciao is installed correctly on your system (these are the same tests
that you are instructed to do during installation, so you can
obviously skip them if you have done them already at that time):

   * Ciao-related file types (`.pl' source files, `.cpx' executables,
     `.itf,.po,.asr' interface files, `.pls' scripts, etc.) should
     have specific icons associated with them (you can look at the
     files in the folders in the Ciao distribution to check).

   * Double-clicking on the shortcut to `ciaosh'(`.cpx') on the
     desktop should start the typical Prolog-style top-level shell in
     a window. If this shortcut has not been created on the desktop,
     then double-clicking on the `ciaosh'(`.cpx') icon inside the
     `shell' folder within the Ciao source folder should have the
     same effect.

   * In the top-level shell, Ciao library modules should load
     correctly. Type for example `use_module(library(dec10_io)).' at
     the Ciao top-level prompt -you should get back a prompt with no
     errors reported.

   * To exit the top level shell, type `halt.' as usual, or <^D>.


Also, the following documentation-related actions should work:

   * Double-clicking on the shortcut to `ciao'(`.html') which appears
     on the desktop should show the Ciao manual in your default WWW
     browser. If this shortcut has not been created you can
     double-click on the `ciao'(`.html') file in the
     `doc\reference\ciao_html' folder inside the Ciao source folder.
     Make sure you configure your browser to use _style sheets_ for
     correct formatting of the manual (note, however, that some older
     versions of Explorer did not support style sheets well and will
     give better results turning them off).

   * The `doc\reference' folder contains the manual also in the other
     formats present in the distribution, such as `info' (very
     convenient for users of the `emacs' editor/program development
     system) and `postscript' or `pdf', which are specially useful
     for printing. See *note Printing manuals (Win32):: for
     instructions.

3.2.1 Starting/exiting the top-level shell (Win32)
--------------------------------------------------

The basic methods for starting/exiting the top-level shell have been
discussed above. The installation script also leaves a
`ciaosh'(`.bat') file inside the `shell' folder of the Ciao
distribution which can be used to start the top-level shell from the
command line in Windows systems.

3.2.2 Getting help (Win32)
--------------------------

The basic methods for accessing the manual on-line have also been
discussed above. Use the table of contents and the indices of
_predicates_, _libraries_, _concepts_, etc. to find what you are
looking for.  Context-sensitive help is available within the `emacs'
environment (see below).

3.2.3 Compiling and running programs (Win32)
--------------------------------------------

Once the shell is started, you can compile and execute Ciao modules
inside the interactive toplevel shell in the standard way. E.g., type
`use_module(_file_).', `use_module(library(_file_)).' for library
modules, `ensure_loaded(_file_).' for files which are not modules,
and `use_package(_file_).' for library packages (these are
syntactic/semantic packages that extend the Ciao language in many
different ways). Note that the use of `compile/1' and `consult/1' is
discouraged in Ciao.

   For example, you may want to type `use_package(iso)' to ensure
Ciao has loaded all the ISO builtins (whether this is done by default
or not depends on your `.ciaorc' file). Do not worry about any
"module already in executable" messages -these are normal and simply
mean that a certain module is already pre-loaded in the toplevel
shell. At this point, typing `write(hello).' should work.

   Note that some predicates that may be built-ins in typical Prolog
implementations are available through libraries in Ciao. This
facilitates making small executables.

   To change the working directory to, say, the `examples' directory
in the Ciao source directory, first do:

           ?- use_module(library(system)).

(loading the `system' library makes a number of system-related
predicates such as `cd/1' accessible) and then:

           ?- cd('$/examples').

(in Ciao the sequence `$/' _at the beginning of a path name_ is
replaced by the path of the Ciao root directory).

3.2.4 Generating executables (Win32)
------------------------------------

Executables can be generated from the toplevel shell (using `make_exec/2')
or using the standalone compiler ( `ciaoc'(`.cpx'), located in the
`ciaoc' folder). To be able to make an executable, the file should
define the predicate `main/1' (or `main/0'), which will be called
upon startup (see the corresponding manual section for details).

For example, within the `examples' directory, you can type:

         ?- make_exec(hw,_).

which should produce an executable. Double-clicking on this
executable should execute it.

   Another way of creating Ciao executables from source files is by
right-clicking on `.pl' files and choosing "make executable". This
uses the standalone compiler (this has the disadvantage, however,
that it is sometimes difficult to see the error messages).

   For more information see *note The interactive top-level shell::
and *note The stand-alone command-line compiler::.

3.2.5 Running Ciao scripts (Win32)
----------------------------------

Double-clicking on files ending in `.pls', _Ciao scripts_, will also
execute them. These are files containing Ciao source but which get
executed without having to explicitly compile them (in the same way
as, e.g., `.bat' files or programs in scripting languages). As an
example, you can double-click on the file `hw.pls' in the `examples'

recompile!).

   As you can see, the file should define the predicate `main/1' (not `main/0'),
which will be called upon startup. The two header lines are only
necessary in Un*x. In Windows you can leave them in or you can take
them out, but leaving them in has the advantage that the script will

PART I - The program development environment
********************************************

*Author(s):* The CLIP Group.

   This part documents the components of the basic Ciao program
development environment. They include:

ciaoc:
     the standalone compiler, which creates executables without
     having to enter the interactive top-level.

ciaosh:
     (also invoked simply as `ciao') is an interactive top-level
     shell, similar to the one found on most Prolog systems (with
     some enhancements).

debugger.pl:
     a Byrd box-type debugger, similar to the one found on most
     Prolog systems (also with some enhancements, such as
     source-level debugging). This is not a standalone application,
     but is rather included in `ciaosh', as is done in other systems
     supporting the Prolog language. However, it is also
     _embeddable_, in the sense that it can be included as a library
     in executables, and activated dynamically and conditionally
     while such executables are running.

ciao-shell:
     an interpreter/compiler for _Ciao scripts_ (i.e., files
     containing Ciao code which run without needing explicit
     compilation).

ciao.el:
     a _complete program development enviroment_, based on GNU emacs,
     with syntax coloring, direct access to all the tools described
     above (as well as the preprocessor and the documenter), atomatic
     location of errors, source-level debugging, context-sensitive
     access to on-line help/manuals, etc. The use of this environment
     is _very highly recommended_!


   The Ciao program development environment also includes `ciaopp',
the preprocessor, and `lpdoc', the documentation generator, which are

   `ciaoc' [CH00b] is the Ciao stand-alone command-line compiler.  `ciaoc'
can be used to create executables or to compile individual files to
object code (to be later linked with other files).  `ciaoc' is
specially useful when working from the command line. Also, it can be
called to compile Ciao programs from other tools such as, e.g., shell
scripts, `Makefile's, or project files. All the capabilities of `ciaoc'
are also available from the interactive top-level shell, which uses
the ciaoc modules as its components.

4.1 Introduction to building executables
========================================

An _executable_ can be built from a single file or from a collection
of inter-related files. In the case of only one file, this file must
define the predicate `main/0' or `main/1'. This predicate is the one
which will be called when the executable is started. As an example,
consider the following file, called `hello.pl':

     main :-
          write('Hello world'),
          nl.

To compile it from the command line using the `ciaoc' standalone
compiler it suffices to type "`ciaoc hello'" (in Win32 you may have
to put the complete path to the `ciaoc' folder of the Ciao
distribution, where the installation process leaves a `ciaoc.bat'
file):

     /herme@clip:/tmp
     [60]> ciaoc hello

     /herme@clip:/tmp
     [61]>

This produces an executable called `hello' in Un*x-like systems and
`hello.cpx' under Win32 systems. This executable can then be run in
Win32 by double-clicking on it and on Un*x systems by simply typing
its name (see for *note Running executables from the command line::
for how to run executables from the command line in Win32):

     /herme@clip:/tmp
     [61]> hello
     Hello world

   If the application is composed of several files the process is
identical. Assume `hello.pl' is now:

     :- use_module(aux, [p/1]).

     main :-
          p(X),
          write(X),
          nl.

where the file `aux.pl' contains:

     :- module(aux,[p/1]).

     p('Hello world').

This can again be compiled using the `ciaoc' standalone compiler as
before:

     /herme@clip:/tmp
     [60]> ciaoc hello

     /herme@clip:/tmp
     [61]> hello
     Hello world

The invocation of `ciaoc hello' compiles the file `hello.pl' and all
connected files that may need recompilation - in this case the file
`aux.pl'. Also, if any library files used had not been compiled
previously they would be compiled at this point (See *note
Intermediate files in the compilation process::). Also, if, say,
`hello.pl' is changed and recompiled, the object code resulting from
the previous compilation of `aux.pl' will be reused. This is all done
without any need for `Makefile's, and considerably accelerates the
development process for large applications. This process can be
observed by selecting the `-v' option when invoking `ciaoc' (which is
equivalent to setting the `verbose_compilation' Prolog flag to `on'
in the top-level interpreter).

   If `main/1' is defined instead of `main/0' then when the
executable is started the argument of `main/1' will be instantiated
to a list of atoms, each one of them corresponding to a command line
option. Consider the file `say.pl':

     main(Argv) :-
          write_list(Argv), nl.

     write_list([]).
     write_list([Arg|Args]) :-
          write(Arg),
          write(' '),
          write_list(Args).

Compiling this program and running it results in the following output:

     /herme@clip:/tmp
     [91]> ciaoc say

     /herme@clip:/tmp
     [91]> say hello dolly
     hello dolly

   The name of the generated executable can be controlled with the
`-o' option (See *note Usage (ciaoc)::).

4.2 Paths used by the compiler during compilation
=================================================

The compiler will look for files mentioned in commands such as `use_module/1'
or `ensure_loaded/1' in the current directory. Other paths can be
added by including them in a file whose name is given to `ciaoc'
using the `-u' option. This file should contain facts of the
predicates `file_search_path/2' and `library_directory/1' (see the
documentation for these predicates and also *note Customizing library
paths and path aliases:: for details).

4.3 Running executables from the command line
=============================================

As mentioned before, what the `ciaoc' compiler generates and how it
is started varies somewhat from OS to OS. In general, the product of
compiling an application with `ciaoc' is a file that contains the
bytecode (the product of the compilation) and invokes the Ciao engine
on it.

   * Un Un*x this is a _script_ (see the first lines of the file)
     which invokes the ciao engine on this file. To run the generated
     executable from a Un*x shell, or from the `bash' shell that
     comes with the Cygwin libraries (see *note Installation and
     compilation under Windows::) it suffices to type its name at the
     shell command line, as in the examples above.

   * In a Win32 system, the compiler produces a similar file with a
     `.cpx' ending. The Ciao installation process typically makes
     sure that the Windows registry contains the right entries so
     that this executable will run upon double-cliking on it.

     In you want to run the executable from the command line an
     additional `.bat' file is typically needed. To help in doing
     this, the Win32 installation process creates a `.bat' skeleton
     file called `bat_skel' in the `Win32' folder of the
     distribution) which allows running Ciao executables from the
     command line. If you want to run a Ciao executable `file.cpx'
     from the command line, you normally copy the skeleton file to
     the folder were the executable is and rename it to `file.bat',
     then change its contents as explained in a comment inside the
     file itself.

     Note that this `.bat' file is usually not necessary in NT, as
     its command shell understands file extension associations. I.e.,
     in windows NT it is possible to run the `file.cpx' executable
     directly. Due to limitations of `.bat' files in Windows 95/98,
     in those OSs no more than 9 command line arguments can be passed
     to the executable (in NT there is no such restriction).

     Finally, in a system in which Cygnus Win32 is installed
     executables can also be used directly from the `bash' shell
     command line, without any associated `.bat' files, by simply
     typing their name at the `bash' shell command line, in the same
     way as in Un*x. This only requires that the `bash' shell which
     comes with Cygnus Win32 be installed and accessible: simply,
     make sure that `/bin/sh.exe' exists.


   Except for a couple of header lines, the contents of executables
are almost identical under different OSs (except for self-contained
ones). The bytecode they contain is architecture-independent. In
fact, it is possible to create an executable under Un*x and run it on
Windows or viceversa, by making only minor modifications (e.g.,
creating the `.bat' file and/or setting environment variables or
editing the start of the file to point to the correct engine
location).

4.4 Types of executables generated
==================================

While the default options used by `ciaoc' are sufficient for normal
use, by selecting other options `ciaoc' can generate several
different types of executables, which offer interesting tradeoffs
among size of the generated executable, portability, and startup time
[CH00b]:

Dynamic executables:
     `ciaoc' produces by default _dynamic_ executables. In this case
     the executable produced is a platform-independent file which
     includes in compiled form all the user defined files. On the
     other hand, any system libraries used by the application are
     loaded dynamically at startup. More precisely, any files that
     appear as `library(...)' in `use_module/1' and `ensure_loaded/1'
     declarations will not be included explicitly in the executable
     and will instead be loaded dynamically. Is is also possible to
     mark other path aliases (see the documentation for `file_search_path/2')
     for dynamic loading by using the `-d' option. Files accessed
     through such aliases will also be loaded dynamically.

     Dynamic loading allows making smaller executables. Such
     executables may be used directly in the same machine in which
     they were compiled, since suitable paths to the location of the
     libraries will be included as default in the executable by `ciaoc'
     during compilation.

     The executable can also be used in another machine, even if the
     architecture and OS are different. The requirement is that the
     Ciao libraries (which will also include the appropriate Ciao
     engine for that architecture and OS) be installed in the target
     machine, and that the `CIAOLIB' and `CIAOENGINE' environment
     variables are set appropriately for the executable to be able to
     find them (see *note Environment variables used by Ciao
     executables::). How to do this differs slightly from OS to OS.

Static executables:
     Selecting the `-s' option `ciaoc' produces a _static_
     executable. In this case the executable produced (again a platform-independent
     file) will include in it all the auxiliary files and any system
     libraries needed by the application. Thus, such an executable is
     almost complete, needing in order to run only the Ciao engine,
     which is platform-specific.(1) Again, if the executable is run
     in the same machine in which it was compiled then the engine is
     found automatically. If the executable is moved to another
     machine, the executable only needs access to a suitable engine
     (which can be done by setting the `CIAOENGINE' environment
     variable to point to this engine).

     This type of compilation produces larger executables, but has
     the advantage that these executables can be installed and run in
     a different machine, with different architecture and OS, even if
     Ciao is not installed on that machine. To install (or
     distribute) such an executable, one only needs to copy the
     executable file itself and the appropriate engine for the target
     platform (See *note Installing Ciao from the source
     distribution:: or *note Installing Ciao from a Win32 binary
     distribution:: and *note Multiarchitecture support::), and to
     set things so that the executable can find the engine. (2)

Dynamic executables, with lazy loading:
     Selecting the `-l' option is very similar to the case of dynamic
     executables above, except that the code in the library modules
     is not loaded when the program is started but rather it is done
     during execution, the first time a predicate defined in that
     file is called. This is advantageous if a large application is
     composed of many parts but is such that typically only some of
     the parts are used in each invocation. The Ciao preprocessor, `ciaopp',
     is a good example of this: it has many capabilitites but
     typically only some of them are used in a given session. An
     executable with lazy load has the advantage that it starts fast,
     loading a minimal functionality on startup, and then loads the
     different modules automatically as needed.

Self-contained executables:
     _Self-contained_ executables are static executables (i.e., this
     option also implies _static_ compilation) which include a Ciao
     engine along with the bytecode, so they do not depend on an
     external one for their execution. This is useful to create
     executables which run even if the machine where the program is
     to be executed does not have a Ciao engine installed and/or
     libraries. The disadvantage is that such execuatbles are platform-dependent
     (as well as larger than those that simply use an external
     library). This type of compilation is selected with the `-S'
     option. Cross-compilation is also possible with the `-SS'
     option, so you can specify the target OS and architecture (e.g.
     LINUXi86). To be able to use the latter option, it is necessary
     to have installed a ciaoengine for the target machine in the
     Ciao library (this requires compiling the engine in that
     OS/architecture and installing it, so that it is available in
     the library).

Compressed executables:
     In _compressed_ executables the bytecode is compressed. This
     allows producing smaller executables, at the cost of a slightly
     slower startup time. This is selected with the `-z' option. You
     can also produce compressed libraries if you use `-zl' along
     with the `-c' option. If you select `-zl' while generating an
     executable, any library which is compiled to accomplish this
     will be also compressed.

Active modules:
     The compiler can also compile (via the `-a' option) a given file
     into an _active module_ (see *note Active modules (high-level
     distributed execution):: for a description of this).


   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Currently there is an exception to this related to libraries
which are written in languages other than Prolog, as, e.g., C. C
files are currently always compiled to dynamically loadable object
files (`.so' files), and they thus need to be included manually in a
distribution of an application. This will be automated in upcoming
versions of the Ciao system.

   (2) It is also possible to produce real standalone executables,
i.e., executables that do not need to have an engine around. However,
this is not automated yet, although it is planned for an upcoming
version of the compiler. In particular, the compiler can generate a
`.c' file for each `.pl' file. Then all the `.c' files can be
compiled together into a real executable (the engine is added one
more element during link time) producing a complete executable for a
given architecture. The downside of course is that such an executable
will not be portable to other architectures without recompilation.

4.5 Environment variables used by Ciao executables
==================================================

The executables generated by the Ciao compiler (including the ciao
development tools themselves) locate automatically where the Ciao
engine and libraries have been installed, since those paths are
stored as defaults in the engine and compiler at installation time.
Thus, there is no need for setting any environment variables in order
to _run_ Ciao executables (on a single architecture - see *note
Multiarchitecture support:: for running on multiple architectures).

   However, the default paths can be overridden by using the
environment variables `CIAOENGINE' and `CIAOLIB'. The first one will
tell the Ciao executables where to look for an engine, and the second
will tell them where to look for the libraries. Thus, it is possible
to actually use the Ciao system without installing it by setting
these variables to the following values:
   * `CIAOENGINE': `$(CIAOSRC)/build/bin/$(CIAOARCH)/ciaoengine'

   * `CIAOLIB': `$(CIAOSRC)'

   where `$(CIAOARCH)' is the string echoed by the command
`CIAOSRC/etc/ciao_get_arch' (or `BINROOT/ciao_get_arch', after
installation).

   This allows using alternate engines or libraries, which can be
very useful for system development and experimentation.

4.6 Intermediate files in the compilation process
=================================================

Compiling an individual source (i.e., `.pl') file produces a `.itf'
file and a `.po' file. The `.itf' file contains information of the _modular
interface_ of the file, such as information on exported and imported
predicates and on the other modules used by this module. This
information is used to know if a given file should be recompiled at a
given point in time and also to be able to detect more errors
statically including undefined predicates, mismatches on predicate
charaterictics across modules, etc. The `.po' file contains the
platform-independent object code for a file, ready for linking
(statically or dynamically).

   It is also possible to use `ciaoc' to explicitly generate the
`.po' file for one or more `.pl' files by using the `-c' option.

   If you want to view the wam instructions of one or more `.pl'
files you can use the `-w' option. That will generate a `.wam' file
with such instructions in a pretty format per each `.pl' file.

The following provides details on the different command line options
available when invoking `ciaoc':



     ciaoc <MiscOpts> <ExecOpts> [-o <execname>] <file> ...

       Make an executable from the listed files.  If there is
       more than one file, they must be non-module, and the
       first one must include the main predicate.  The -o
       option allows generating an arbitrary executable name.

     ciaoc <MiscOpts> <ExecOpts> -a <publishmod> <module>

       Make an active module executable from <module> with
       address publish module <publishmod>.

     ciaoc <MiscOpts> -c  <file> ...

       Compile listed files (make .po objects).

     ciaoc <MiscOpts> -w  <file> ...

4.8 Known bugs and planned improvements (`ciaoc')
=================================================

   * Run-time checks have been reported not to work with this code.
     That means that either the assertions here, or the code that
     implements the run-time checks are erroneous.

   * Also if appears in the body of an assertion referred to a
     predicate being used, but that is not implemented, because the
     assertion reader is not included in the compiler yet - EMM.

*********************************

*Author(s):* Daniel Cabeza, The CLIP Group.

   `ciaosh' is the Ciao interactive top-level shell. It provides the
user with an interactive programming environment with tools for
incrementally building programs, debugging programs by following
their executions, and modifying parts of programs without having to
start again from scratch. If available, it is strongly recommended to
use it with the emacs interface provided, as it greatly simplifies
the operation. This chapter documents general operation in the shell
itself.

File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Shell invocation and startup,  Next: Shell interaction,  Prev: The interactive top-level shell,  Up: The interactive top-level shell

5.1 Shell invocation and startup
================================

When invoked, the shell responds with a message of identification and
the prompt `?- ' as soon as it is ready to accept input, thus:

     Ciao-Prolog X.Y #PP: Thu Mar 25 17:20:55 MET 1999
     ?-

   When the shell is initialized it looks for a file `.ciaorc' in the
HOME directory and makes an `include' of it, if it exists. This file
is useful for including `use_module/1' declarations for the modules
one wants to be loaded by default, changing prolog flags, etc. (Note
that the `.ciaorc' file can only contain directives, not actual code;
to load some code at startup put it in a separate file and load it
using e.g. a `use_module/1' declaration.) If the initialization file
does not exist, the default package `default_for_ciaosh' is included,
to provide more or less what other prologs define by default. Thus,
if you want to have available all builtins you had before adding the
initialization file, you have to include `:-
use_package(default_for_ciaosh)' in it. Two command-line options
control the loading of the initialization file:

`-f'
     Fast start, do not load any initialization file.

`-l' `File'
     Look for initialization file `File' instead of `~/.ciaorc'. If
     it does not exist, include the default package.



File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Shell interaction,  Next: Entering recursive (conjunctive) shell levels,  Prev: Shell invocation and startup,  Up: The interactive top-level shell

5.2 Shell interaction
=====================

After the shell outputs the prompt, it is expecting either an
internal command (see the following sections) or a _query_ (a goal or
sequence of goals). When typing in the input, which must be a valid
prolog term, if the term does not end in the first line, subsequent
lines are indented. For example:

     ?- X =
        f(a,
        b).

     X = f(a,b) ?

     yes
     ?-

   The queries are executed by the shell as if they appeared in the user
module. Thus, in addition to builtin predicates, predicates available
to be executed directly are all predicates defined by loaded user
files (files with no module declaration), and imported predicates
from modules by the use of `use_module'.

   The possible answers of the shell, after executing an internal
command or query, are:

   * If the execution failed (or produced an error), the answer is
     `no'.

   * If the execution was successful and bindings where made (or
     constraints where imposed) on answer variables, then the shell
     outputs the values of answer variables, as a sequence of
     bindings (or constraints), and then prints a `?' as a prompt. At
     this point it is expecting an input line from the user. By
     entering a carriage-return (<RET>) or any line starting with
     `y', the query terminates and the shell answer `yes'. Entering a
     ``,'' the shell enters a recursive level (see below). Finally,
     any other answer forces the system to backtrack and look for the
     next solution (answering as with the first solution).

   * If the execution was successful, but no answer variable was
     bound or constrained, the answer is simply `yes'. This behavior
     can be changed by setting the prolog flag
     `prompt_alternatives_no_bindings' to `on', so that if there are
     more solutions the user will be consulted as explained in the
     previous point (useful if the solutions produce side effects).


   To allow using connection variables in queries without having to
report their results, variables whose name starts with `_' are not
considered in answers, the rest being the _answer variable_s. This
example illustrates the previous points:

     ?- member(a, [b, c]).

     no
     ?- member(a, [a, b]).

     yes
     ?- member(X, [a|L]).

     X = a ? ;

     L = [X|_] ?

     yes
     ?- atom_codes(ciao, _C), member(L, _C).

     L = 99 ? ;

     L = 105 ? ;

     L = 97 ? ;

     L = 111 ? ;

     no
     ?-

5.3 Entering recursive (conjunctive) shell levels
=================================================

As stated before, when the user answers with ``,'' after a solution
is presented, the shell enters a _recursive level_, changing its
prompt to _N_ `?- ' (where _N_ is the recursion level) and keeping
the bindings or constraints of the solution (this is inspired by the _LogIn_
language developed by H. Ait-Kaci, P. Lincoln and Roger Nasr
[AKNL86]). Thus, the following queries will be executed within that
context, and all variables in the lower level solutions will be
reported in subsequent solutions at this level. To exit a recursive
level, input an <EOF> character or the command `up'. The last
solution after entering the level is repeated, to allow asking for
more solutions. Use command `top' to exit all recursive levels and
return to the top level. Example interaction:

     ?- directory_files('.',_Fs), member(F,_Fs).

     F = 'file_utils.po' ? ,

     1 ?- file_property(F, mod_time(T)).

     F = 'file_utils.po',
     T = 923497679 ?

     yes
     1 ?- up.

     F = 'file_utils.po' ? ;

     F = 'file_utils.pl' ? ;

     F = 'file_utils.itf' ? ,

     1 ?- file_property(F, mod_time(T)).

     F = 'file_utils.itf',
     T = 923497679 ?

     yes
     1 ?- ^D
     F = 'file_utils.itf' ?

     yes
     ?-

Chikayama (first version), K. Shen (first version).

   The Ciao program development environment includes a number of
advanced debugging tools, such as a source-level debugger, the `ciaopp'
preprocessor, and some execution visualizers. Herein we discuss the
interactive debugger available in the standard top-level, which
allows tracing the control flow of programs, in a similar way to
other popular Prolog systems. This is a classical Byrd _box-type_ _debugger_ [Byr80,BBP81],
with some enhancements, most notably being able to track the
execution on the source program.

   We also discuss the embedded debugger, which is a version of the
debugger which can be embedded into executables. It allows triggering
an interactive debugging session at any time while running an
executable, without any need for the top-level shell.

   Byrd's Procedure Box model of debugging execution provides a
simple way of visualising control flow, including backtracking.
Control flow is in principle viewed at the predicate level, rather
than at the level of individual clauses. The Ciao debugger has the
ability to mark selected modules and/or files for debugging
(traditional and source debugging), rather than having to
exhaustively trace the program. It also allows to selectively set spy-points
and breakpoints. Spy-points allow the programmer to nominate
interesting predicates at which program execution is to pause so that
the programmer can interact with the debugger. Breakpoints are
similar to spy-points, but allow pausing at a specific line in the
code, corresponding to a particular literal. There is a wide choice
of control and information options available during debugging
interaction.

   *Note*: While the debugger described herein can be used in a
standalone way (i.e., from an operating system shell or terminal
window) in the same way as other Prolog debuggers, the most
convenient way of debugging Ciao programs is by using the programming
environment (see *note Using Ciao inside GNU emacs::). This
environment has many debugging-related facilities, including
displaying the source code for the module(s) corresponding to the
procedure being executed, and higlighting dynamically the code
segments corresponding to the different execution steps.

6.1 Marking modules and files for debugging in the top-level debugger
=====================================================================

The Ciao debugger is module-based. This allows skipping during the
debugging process all files (including system library files) except
those in which a bug is suspected. This saves having to explictily
and repetitively skip predicates in unrelated files during the
debugging process. Also, there is an efficieny advantage: in order to
be able to run the debugger on a module, it must be loaded in _debug
(interpreted) mode_, which will execute slower than normal (compiled)
modules. Thus, it is interesting to compile in debug mode only those
modules that need to be traced. Instead of doing this (loading of
modules in one mode or another) by hand each time, in Ciao
(re)loading of modules in the appropriate mode is handled
automatically by the Ciao compiler. However, this requires the user
to _mark explicitly_ the modules in which debugging is to be
performed. The simplest way of achieving this is by executing in the
Ciao shell prompt, for each suspicious module `Module' in the
program, the command:

     ?- debug_module(Module).

or, alternatively:

     ?- debug_module_source(Module).

which in addition instructs the debugger to keep track of the line
numbers in the source file and to report them during debugging. This
is most useful when running the top-level inside the `emacs' editor
since in that case the Ciao emacs mode allows performing full source-level
debugging in each module marked as above, i.e., the source lines
being executed will be highlighted dynamically during debugging in a
window showing the source code of the module.

   Note that, since all files with no module declaration belong to
the pseudo-module `user', the command to be issued for debugging a
user file, say `foo.pl', is `debug_module(user)' or
`debug_module_source(user)', and not `debug_module(foo)'.

   The two ways of performing source-level debugging are fully
compatible between them, i.e., Ciao allows having some modules loaded
with `debug_module/1' and others with `debug_module_source/1'. To
change from one interpreted mode to the other mode it suffices to
select the module with the new interpreted mode (debugger mode),
using the appropiate command, and reload the module.

   The commands above perform in fact two related actions: first,
they let the compiler know that if a file containing a module with
this name is loaded, it should be loaded in interpreted mode (source
or traditional). In addition, they instruct the debugger to actually
prepare for debugging the code belonging to that module. After that,
the modules which are to be debugged have to be (re)loaded so that
they are compiled or loaded for interpretation in the appropriate
way. The nice thing is that, due to the modular behaviour of the
compiler/top-level, if the modules are part of a bigger application,
it suffices to load the main module of the application, since this
will automatically force the dependent modules which have changed to
be loaded in the appropriate way, including those whose _loading
mode_ has changed (i.e., changing the loading mode has the effect of
forcing the required re-loading of the module at the appropriate
time).

   Later in the debugging process, as the bug location is isolated,
typically one will want to restrict more and more the modules where
debugging takes place. To this end, and without the need for
reloading, one can tell the debugger to not consider a module for
debugging issuing a `nodebug_module/1' command, which counteracts a `debug_module/1'
or `debug_module_source/1' command with the same module name, and
reloading it (or the main file).

   There are also two top-level commands `set_debug_mode/1' and `set_nodebug_mode/1',
which accept as argument a file spec (i.e., `library(foo)' or `foo',
even if it is a user file) to be able to load a file in interpreted
mode without changing the set of modules that the debugger will try
to spy.

6.2 The debugging process
=========================

Once modules or user files are marked for debugging and reloaded, the
traditional debugging shell commands can be used (the documentation
of the `debugger' library following this chapter contains all the
commands and their description), with the same meaning as in other
classical Prolog systems. The differences in their behavior are:

   * Debugging takes place only in the modules in which it was
     activated,

   * `nospy/1' and `spy/1' accept sequences of predicate specs, and
     they will search for those predicates only in the modules marked
     for debugging (traditional or source-level debugging).

   * `breakpt/6' and `nobreakpt/6' allow setting breakpoints at
     selected clause literals and will search for those literals only
     in the modules marked for source-level debugging (modules marked
     with `debug_module_source/1').


   In particular, the system is initially in nodebug mode, in which
no tracing is performed. The system can be put in debug mode by a
call to `debug/0' in which execution of queries will proceed until
the first _spy-point_ or _breakpoint_. Alternatively, the system can
be put in trace mode by a call to `trace/0' in which all predicates
will be trace.

6.3 Marking modules and files for debugging with the embedded debugger
======================================================================

The embedded debugger, as the interpreted debugger, has three
different modes of operation: debug, trace or nodebug. These debugger
modes can be set by adding _one_ of the following package
declarations to the module:

     :- use_package(debug).
     :- use_package(trace).
     :- use_package(nodebug).

and recompiling the application. These declarations _must_ appear the
last ones of all `use_package' declarations used. Also it is
possible, as usual, to add the debugging package(s) in the module
declaration using the third argument of the `module/3' declaration
(and they should also be the last ones in the list), i.e., using one
of:

     :- module(..., ..., [..., debug]).
     :- module(..., ..., [..., trace]).
     :- module(..., ..., [..., nodebug]).

   The nodebug mode allows turning off any debugging (and also the
corresponding overhead) but keeping the spy-points and breakpoints in
the code. The trace mode will start the debugger for any predicate in
the file.

   The embedded debugger has limitations over the interpreted
debugger. The most important is that the "retry" option is not
available. But it is possible to add, and remove, spy-points and breakpoins
using the predicates `spy/1', `nospy/1', `breakpt/6' and `nobreakpt/6',
etc. These can be used in a clause declaration or as declarations.
Also it is possible to add in the code predicates for issuing the
debugger (i.e., use debug mode, and in a clause add the predicate `trace/0').
Finally, if a spy declaration is placed on the entry point of an
executable (`:- spy(main/1)') the debugger will not start the first
time `main/1' predicate is called, i.e., at the beginning of program
execution (however, it will if there are any subsequent calls to `main/1').
Starting the embedded debugger at the beginning of the execution of a
program can be done easily however by simply adding the in trace mode.

   Note that there is a particularly interesting way of using the embedded
debugger: if an _application_ is run in a shell buffer which has been
set with Ciao inferior mode (<M-x> `ciao-inferior-mode') and this
application starts emitting output from the embedded debugger (i.e.,
which contains the embedded debugger and is debugging its code) then
the Ciao emacs mode will be able to follow these messages, for
example tracking execution in the source level code. This also works
if the application is written in a combination of languages, provided
the parts written in Ciao are compiled with the embedded debugger
package and is thus a covenient way of debugging multi-language
applications. The only thing needed is to make sure that the output
messages appear in a shell buffer that is in Ciao inferior mode.

   See the following as a general example of use of the embedded
debugger:
     :- module( foo,[main/1],[assertions, debug]).

     :- entry main/1.

     main(X) :-
              display(X),
              spy(foo),
              foo(X),
              notrace,
              nl.

     foo([]).
     foo([X|T]) :-
             trace,
             bar(X),
             foo(T).

     bar(X) :-
             display(X).

6.4 The procedure box control flow model
========================================

During debugging the interpreter prints out a sequence of goals in
various states of instantiation in order to show the state that the
program has reached in its execution. However, in order to understand
what is occurring it is necessary to understand when and why the
interpreter prints out goals. As in other programming languages, key
points of interest are procedure entry and return, but in Prolog
there is the additional complexity of backtracking. One of the major
confusions that novice Prolog programmers have to face is the
question of what actually happens when a goal fails and the system
suddenly starts backtracking. The Procedure Box model of Prolog
execution views program control flow in terms of movement about the
program text. This model provides a basis for the debugging mechanism
in the interpreter, and enables the user to view the behaviour of the
program in a consistent way. It also provides the basis for the
visualization performed on the source level program when source level
program when source-level debugging is activated within `emacs'.

   Let us look at an example Prolog procedure:

   The first clause states that `Y' is a descendant of `X' if `Y' is
an offspring of `X', and the second clause states that `Y' is a
descendant of `X' if `Z' is an offspring of `X' and `Y' is a
descendant of `Z'. In the diagram a box has been drawn around the
whole procedure and labelled arrows indicate the control flow in and
out of this box. There are four such arrows which we shall look at in
turn.

   * *Call*

     This arrow represents initial invocation of the procedure. When
     a goal of the form `descendant(X,Y)' is required to be
     satisfied, control passes through the Call port of the
     descendant box with the intention of matching a component clause
     and then satisfying any subgoals in the body of that clause.
     Note that this is independent of whether such a match is
     possible; i.e. first the box is called, and then the attempt to
     match takes place. Textually we can imagine moving to the code
     for descendant when meeting a call to descendant in some other
     part of the code.

   * *Exit*

     This arrow represents a successful return from the procedure.
     This occurs when the initial goal has been unified with one of
     the component clauses and any subgoals have been satisfied.
     Control now passes out of the Exit port of the descendant box.
     Textually we stop following the code for descendant and go back
     to the place we came from.

   * *Redo*

     This arrow indicates that a subsequent goal has failed and that
     the system is backtracking in an attempt to find alternatives to
     previous solutions. Control passes through the Redo port of the
     descendant box. An attempt will now be made to resatisfy one of
     the component subgoals in the body of the clause that last
     succeeded; or, if that fails, to completely rematch the original
     goal with an alternative clause and then try to satisfy any
     subgoals in the body of this new clause. Textually we follow the
     code backwards up the way we came looking for new ways of
     succeeding, possibly dropping down on to another clause and
     following that if necessary.

   * *Fail*

     This arrow represents a failure of the initial goal, which might
     occur if no clause is matched, or if subgoals are never
     satisfied, or if any solution produced is always rejected by
     later processing. Control now passes out of the Fail port of the
     descendant box and the system continues to backtrack. Textually
     we move back to the code which called this procedure and keep
     moving backwards up the code looking for choice points.

   In terms of this model, the information we get about the procedure
box is only the control flow through these four ports. This means
that at this level we are not concerned with which clause matches,
and how any subgoals are satisfied, but rather we only wish to know
the initial goal and the final outcome. However, it can be seen that
whenever we are trying to satisfy subgoals, what we are actually
doing is passing through the ports of _their_ respective boxes. If we
were following this (e.g., activating source-level debugging), then
we would have complete information about the control flow inside the
procedure box.

   Note that the box we have drawn around the procedure should really
be seen as an invocation box. That is, there will be a different box
for each different invocation of the procedure. Obviously, with
something like a recursive procedure, there will be many different
Calls and Exits in the control flow, but these will be for different
invocations. Since this might get confusing each invocation box is
given a unique integer identifier in the messages, as described below.

   Note that not all procedure calls are traced; there are a few
basic predicates which have been made invisible since it is more
convenient not to trace them. These include debugging directives,
basic control structures, and some builtins. This means that messages
will never be printed for these predicates during debugging.

6.5 Format of debugging messages
================================

This section explains the two formats of the message output by the
debugger at a port. All trace messages are output to the terminal
regardless of where the current output stream is directed (which
allows tracing programs while they are performing file I/O). The
basic format, which will be shown in traditional debug and in
source-level debugging within Ciao `emacs' mode, is as follows:

     S  13  7  Call: T user:descendant(dani,_123) ?

   `S' is a spy-point or breakpoint indicator. It is printed as
'`+'', indicating that there is a spy-point on `descendant/2' in
module `user', as `'B'' denoting a breakpoint, or as ' ', denoting no
spy-point or breakpoint. If there is a spy-point and a breakpoint in
the same predicate the spy-point indicator takes preference over
breakpoint indicator.

   `T' is a subterm trace. This is used in conjunction with the `^'
command (set subterm), described below. If a subterm has been
selected, `T' is printed as the sequence of commands used to select
the subterm. Normally, however, `T' is printed as ' ', indicating
that no subterm has been selected.

   The first number is the unique invocation identifier. It is always
nondecreasing (provided that the debugger is switched on) regardless
of whether or not the invocations are being actually seen. This
number can be used to cross correlate the trace messages for the
various ports, since it is unique for every invocation. It will also
give an indication of the number of procedure calls made since the
start of the execution. The invocation counter starts again for every
fresh execution of a command, and it is also reset when retries (see
later) are performed.

   The number following this is the _current depth_; i.e., the number
of direct _ancestors_ this goal has. The next word specifies the
particular port (`Call', `Exit', `Redo' or `Fail'). The goal is then
printed so that its current instantiation state can be inspected. The
final `?' is the prompt indicating that the debugger is waiting for
user interaction. One of the option codes allowed (see below) can be
input at this point.

   The second format, quite similar to the format explained above, is
shown when using source-level debugging outside the Ciao `emacs'
mode, and it is as follows:

     	   In /home/mcarlos/ciao/foo.pl (5-9) descendant-1
     S  13  7  Call: T user:descendant(dani,_123) ?

   This format is identical to the format above except for the first
line, which contains the information for location of the point in the
source program text where execution is currently at. The first line
contains the name of the source file, the start and end lines where
the literal can be found, the substring to search for between those
lines and the number of substrings to locate. This information for
locating the point on the source file is not shown when executing the
source-level debugger from the Ciao `emacs' mode.

   Ports can be "unleashed" by calling the `leash/1' predicate
omiting that port in the argument. This means that the debugger will
stop but user interaction is not possible for an unleashed port.
Obviously, the `?' prompt will not be shown in such messages, since
the user has specified that no interaction is desired at this point.

6.6 Options available during debugging
======================================

This section describes the particular options that are available when
the debugger prompts after printing out a debugging message. All the
options are one letter mnemonics, some of which can be optionally
followed by a decimal integer. They are read from the terminal with
any blanks being completely ignored up to the next terminator
(carriage-return, line-feed, or escape). Some options only actually
require the terminator; e.g., the creep option, only requires <RET>.

   The only option which really needs to be remembered is '`h''
(followed by <RET>). This provides help in the form of the following
list of available options.

     <cr>   creep            c      creep
      l     leap             s      skip
      r     retry            r <i>  retry i
      f     fail             f <i>  fail i
      d     display          p      print
      w     write            v <I>  variable(s)
      g     ancestors        g <n>  ancestors n
      n     nodebug          =      debugging
      +     spy this         -      nospy this
      a     abort
      @     command          u      unify
      <     reset printdepth < <n>  set printdepth
      ^     reset subterm    ^ <n>  set subterm
      ?     help             h      help

   * `c' ( _creep_)

     causes the debugger to single-step to the very next port and
     print a message. Then if the port is leashed the user is
     prompted for further interaction. Otherwise it continues
     creeping. If leashing is off, creep is the same as leap (see
     below) except that a complete trace is printed on the terminal.

   * `l' ( _leap_)

     causes the interpreter to resume running the program, only
     stopping when a spy-point or breakpoint is reached (or when the
     program terminates). Leaping can thus be used to follow the
     execution at a higher level than exhaustive tracing. All that is
     needed to do is to set spy-points and breakpoints on an evenly
     spread set of pertinent predicates or lines, and then follow the
     control flow through these by leaping from one to the other.

   * `s' ( _skip_)

     is only valid for Call and Redo ports, if it is issued in Exit
     or Fail ports it is equivalent to creep. It skips over the
     entire execution of the predicate. That is, no message will be
     seen until control comes back to this predicate (at either the
     Exit port or the Fail port). Skip is particularly useful while
     creeping since it guarantees that control will be returned after
     the (possibly complex) execution within the box. With skip then
     no message at all will appear until control returns to the Exit
     port or Fail port corresponding to this Call port or Redo port.
     This includes calls to predicates with spy-points and
     breakpoints set: they will be masked out during the skip. There
     is a way of overriding this: the `t' option after a <^C>
     interrupt will disable the masking. Normally, however, this
     masking is just what is required!

   * `r' ( _retry_)

     can be used at any of the four ports (although at the Call port
     it has no effect). It transfers control back to the Call port of
     the box. This allows restarting an invocation when, for example,
     it has left the programmer with some weird result. The state of
     execution is exactly the same as in the original call (unless
     the invocation has performed side effects, which will not be
     undone). When a retry is performed the invocation counter is
     reset so that counting will continue from the current invocation
     number regardless of what happened before the retry. This is in
     accord with the fact that execution has, in operational terms,
     returned to the state before anything else was called.

     If an integer is supplied after the retry command, then this is
     taken as specifying an invocation number and the system tries to
     get to the Call port, not of the current box, but of the
     invocation box specified. It does this by continuously failing
     until it reaches the right place. Unfortunately this process
     cannot be guaranteed: it may be the case that the invocation the
     programmer is looking for has been cut out of the search space
     by cuts in the program. In this case the system fails to the
     latest surviving Call port before the correct one.

   * `f' ( _fail_)

     can be used at any of the four ports (although at the Fail port
     it has no effect). It transfers control to the Fail port of the
     box, forcing the invocation to fail prematurely. If an integer
     is supplied after the command, then this is taken as specifying
     an invocation number and the system tries to get to the Fail
     port of the invocation box specified. It does this by
     continuously failing until it reaches the right place.
     Unfortunately, as before, this process cannot be guaranteed.

   * `d' ( _display_)

     displays the current goal using `display/1'. See `w' below.

   * `p' ( _print_)

     re-prints the current goal using `print/1'. Nested structures
     will be printed to the specified _printdepth_ (see below).

   * `w' ( _write_)

     writes the current goal on the terminal using `write/1'.

   * `v' ( _variables_)

     writes the list of the modified variables and their values. If a
     variable name (identifier) `N' is supplied, then the value of
     variable `N' is shown.

   * `g' ( _ancestors_)

     provides a list of ancestors to the current goal, i.e., all
     goals that are hierarchically above the current goal in the
     calling sequence. It is always possible to jump to any goal in
     the ancestor list (by using retry, etc.). If an integer `n' is
     supplied, then only `n' ancestors will be printed. That is to
     say, the last `n' ancestors will be printed counting back from
     the current goal. Each entry in the list is preceded by the
     invocation number followed by the depth number (as would be
     given in a trace message).

   * `n' ( _nodebug_)

     switches the debugger off. Note that this is the correct way to
     switch debugging off at a trace point. The `@' option cannot be
     used because it always returns to the debugger.

   * `=' ( _debugging_)

     outputs information concerning the status of the current
     debugging session.

   * `+' _spy_

     sets a spy-point on the current goal.

   * `-' ( _nospy_)

     removes the spy-point from the current goal.

   * `a' ( _abort_)

     causes an abort of the current execution. All the execution
     states built so far are destroyed and the system is put right
     back at the top-level of the interpreter. (This is the same as
     the built-in predicate `abort/0'.)

   * `@' ( _command_)

     allows calling arbitrary goals. The initial message `| ?- ' will
     be output on the terminal, and a command is then read from the
     terminal and executed as if it was at top-level.

   * `u' ( _unify_)

     is available at the Call port and gives the option of providing
     a solution to the goal from the terminal rather than executing
     the goal. This is convenient, e.g., for providing a "stub" for a
     predicate that has not yet been written. A prompt `|: ' will be
     output on the terminal, and the solution is then read from the
     terminal and unified with the goal.

   * `<' ( _printdepth_)

     sets a limit for the subterm nesting level that is printed in
     messages. While in the debugger, a printdepth is in effect for
     limiting the subterm nesting level when printing the current
     goal. When displaying or writing the current goal, all nesting
     levels are shown. The limit is initially 10. This command,
     without arguments, resets the limit to 10. With an argument of
     `n' the limit is set to `n'.

   * `^' ( _subterm_)

     sets the subterm to be printed in messages. While at a
     particular port, a current subterm of the current goal is
     maintained. It is the current subterm which is displayed,
     printed, or written when prompting for a debugger command. Used
     in combination with the printdepth, this provides a means for
     navigating in the current goal for focusing on the part which is
     of interest. The current subterm is set to the current goal when
     arriving at a new port. This command, without arguments, resets
     the current subterm to the current goal. With an argument of `n'
     (greater than 0 and less or equal to the number of subterms of
     the current subterm), the current subterm is replaced by its
     `n''th subterm. With an argument of `0', the current subterm is
     replaced by its parent term.

   * `?' or `h' ( _help_)

     displays the table of options given above.

6.7 Calling predicates that are not exported by a module
========================================================

The Ciao module system does not allow calling predicates which are
not exported during debugging. However, as an aid during debugging,
this is allowed (only from the top-level and for modules which are in
debug mode or source-level debug mode) using the `call_in_module/2'
predicate.

   Note that this does not affect analysis or optimization issues,
since it only works on modules which are loaded in debug mode or
source-level debug mode, i.e. unoptimized.

===============================

Originally written by Andrzej Ciepielewski. Minor modifications by
Mats Carlsson. Later modifications (17 Dec 87) by Takashi Chikayama
(making tracer to use `print/1' rather than `write/1', temporarily
switching debugging flag off while writing trace message and within
"break" level). Additional modifications by Kish Shen (May 88):
subterm navigation, handle unbound args in `spy/1' and `nospy/1',
trapping arithmetics errors in debug mode. Adapted then to &-Prolog
and Ciao by Daniel Cabeza and included in the Ciao version control
system. Extended for source-level debugging by Manuel C. Rodri'guez.
Option that shows variable names and values (`v <N>') implemented by
Edison Mera (2009). (See changelog if included in the document or in
the version maintenance system for more detailed documentation on
changes.)

8 The script interpreter
************************

*Author(s):* Daniel Cabeza, Manuel Hermenegildo.

   `ciao-shell' is the Ciao script interpreter. It can be used to
write _Prolog shell scripts_ (see [Her96,CHV96b]), that is,
executable files containing source code, which are compiled on demand.

   Writing Prolog scripts can sometimes be advantageous with respect
to creating binary executables for small- to medium-sized programs
that are modified often and perform relatively simple tasks. The
advantage is that no explicit compilation is necessary, and thus
changes and updates to the program imply only editing the source
file. The disadvantage is that startup of the script (the first time
after it is modified) is slower than for an application that has been
compiled previously.

   An area of application is, for example, writing _CGI executables_:
the slow speed of the network connection in comparison with that of
executing a program makes program execution speed less important and
has made scripting languages very popular for writing these
applications. Logic languages are, a priori, excellent candidates to
be used as scripting languages. For example, the built-in grammars
and databases can sometimes greatly simplify many typical
script-based applications.

File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: How it works,  Next: Command line arguments in scripts,  Prev: The script interpreter,  Up: The script interpreter

8.1 How it works
================

Essentially, `ciao-shell' is a smaller version of the Ciao top-level,
which starts by loading the file given to it as the first argument
and then starts execution at `main/1' (the argument is instantiated
to a list containing the command line options, in the usual way).
Note that the Prolog script cannot have a `module' declaration for
this to work. While loading the file, `ciao-shell' changes the prolog
flag `quiet' so that no informational or warning messages are printed
(error messages will be reported to `user_error', however). The
operation of `ciao-shell' in Unix-like systems is based in a special
compiler feature: when the first character of a file is '`#'', the
compiler skips the first lines until an empty line is found. In
Windows, its use is as easy as naming the file with a `.pls'
extension, which will launch `ciao-shell' appropriately.

   For example, in a Linux/Unix system, assume a file called `hello'
contains the following program:

     #!/bin/sh
     exec ciao-shell $0 "$@" # -*- mode: ciao; -*-

     main(_) :-
          write('Hello world'), nl.

   Then, the file `hello' can be _run_ by simply making it executable
and invoking it from the command line:

     /herme@clip:/tmp
     [86]> chmod +x hello

     /herme@clip:/tmp
     [87]> hello
     Hello world

   The line:
     #!/bin/sh
   invokes the `/bin/sh' shell which will interpret the following
line:
     exec ciao-shell $0 "$@" # -*- mode: ciao; -*-

and invoke `ciao-shell', instructing it to read this same file
(`$0'), passing it the rest of the arguments to `hello' as arguments
to the prolog program. The second part of the line `# -*- mode: ciao;
-*-' is simply a comment which is seen by `emacs' and instructs it to
edit this file in Ciao mode (this is needed because these script
files typically do not have a `.pl' ending). When `ciao-shell'
starts, if it is the first time, it compiles the program (skipping
the first lines, as explained above), or else at successive runs
loads the `.po' object file, and then calls `main/1'.

   Note that the process of creating Prolog scripts is made very
simple by the Ciao emacs mode, which automatically inserts the header
and makes the file executable (See *note Using Ciao inside GNU
emacs::).

8.2 Command line arguments in scripts
=====================================

The following example illustrates the use of command-line arguments
in scripts. Assume that a file called `say' contains the following
lines:

     #!/bin/sh
     exec ciao-shell $0 "$@" # -*- mode: ciao; -*-

     main(Argv) :-
          write_list(Argv), nl.

     write_list([]).
     write_list([Arg|Args]) :-
          write(Arg),
          write(' '),
          write_list(Args).

An example of use is:

     /herme@clip:/tmp
     [91]> say hello dolly
     hello dolly

9 Customizing library paths and path aliases
********************************************

*Author(s):* Daniel Cabeza.

   This library provides means for customizing, from environment
variables, the libraries and path aliases known by an executable.
Many applications of Ciao, including `ciaoc', `ciaosh', and `ciao-shell'
make use of this library. Note that if an executable is created
dynamic, it will try to load its components at startup, before the
procedures of this module can be invoked, so in this case all the
components should be in standard locations.

9.2 Documentation on exports (`libpaths')
=========================================

 -- PREDICATE: get_alias_path/0:
     `get_alias_path'

     Consult the environment variable 'CIAOALIASPATH' and add facts
     to predicates `library_directory/1' and `file_search_path/2' to
     define new library paths and path aliases. The format of
     'CIAOALIASPATH' is a sequence of paths or alias assignments
     separated by colons, an alias assignment is the name of the
     alias, an '=' and the path represented by that alias (no blanks
     allowed). For example, given
             CIAOALIASPATH=/home/bardo/ciao:contrib=/usr/local/lib/ciao
     the predicate will define /home/bardo/ciao as a library path and
     /usr/local/lib/ciao as the path represented by 'contrib'.

10 Using Ciao inside GNU emacs
******************************

*Author(s):* Manuel Hermenegildo, Manuel C. Rodriguez, Daniel Cabeza.

   The Ciao emacs interface (or _mode_ in `emacs' terms) provides a
rich, integrated user interface to the Ciao _program development
environment_ components, including the `ciaosh' interactive top level
and the `ciaopp' preprocessor. While most features of the Ciao
development environment are available from the command line of the
preprocessor and the top-level shell, using Ciao inside `emacs' is
highly recommended. The facilities that this mode provides include:

   * _Syntax-based highlighting_ (coloring), _auto-indentation_, _auto-fill_,
     etc. of code. This includes the assertions used by the
     preprocessor and the documentation strings used by the Ciao
     auto-documenter, `lpdoc'.

   * Providing automatic access to on-line help for all predicates by
     accessing the Ciao system manuals in `info' format.

   * Starting and communicating with `ciaopp', the _Ciao
     preprocessor_, running in its own sub-shell. This allows easily
     performing certain kinds of _static checks_ (useful for finding
     errors in programs before running them), program analysis tasks,
     and _program transformations_ on source programs.

   * Starting and communicating with the _Ciao top-level_, running in
     its own sub-shell. This facilitates loading programs, checking
     the _syntax_ of programs (and of _assertions_ within programs),
     marking and unmarking modules for interactive debugging, _tracing
     the source code_ during debugging, making stand-alone
     executables, compiling modules to dynamically linkable Ciao
     objects, compiling modules to active objects, etc.

   * Syntax highlighting and coloring of the error and warning
     messages produced by the top level, preprocessor, or any other
     tool using the same message format (such as the `lpdoc'
     auto-documenter), and _locating automatically the points in the
     source files where such errors occur_.

   * Performing automatic _version control_ and keeping a _changelog_
     of individual files or whole applications. This is done by
     automatically including changelog entries in source files, which
     can then be processed by the `lpdoc' auto-documenter.


   This chapter explains how to use the Ciao `emacs' interface and
how to set up your `emacs' environment for correct operation. The Ciao `emacs'
interface can also be used to work with traditional Prolog or CLP
systems.

10.1 Conventions for writing Ciao programs under Emacs
======================================================

This is particularly important for the source-level debugger and the syntax-based
coloring capabilities. This is due to the fact that it would be
unrealistic to write a complete Ciao parser in Emacs lisp. These
conventions are the following, in order of importance:

   * Clauses should begin on the first column (this is used to
     recognize the beginning of a clause).

   * C style comments should not be used in a clause, but can be used
     outside any clause.


The following suggestion is not strictly necessary but can improve
operation:

   * Body literals should be indented. There should be not more than
     one literal per line. This allows more precision in the location
     of program points during source-level debugging, i.e., when
     marking breakpoints and during line tracing.


Comments which start with `%'s are indented to the right if
indentation is asked for.

For syntax-based highlighting to be performed font-lock must be
available and not disabled (the Ciao mode enables it but it may be
disabled elsewhere in, e.g., the `.emacs' file).

10.2 Checking the installation
==============================

Typically, a complete pre-installation of the Ciao `emacs' interface
is completed during Ciao installation. To check that installation was
done and sucessful, open a file with a `.pl' ending. You should see
that `emacs' enters Ciao mode: the mode is identified in the status
bar below the buffer and, if the emacs menu bar is enabled, you
should see the Ciao menus. You should be able from the menu-bar, for
example, to go to the Ciao manuals in the info or load the `.pl' file
that you just opened into a Ciao top level.

   If things don't work properly, see the section *note Installation
of the Ciao emacs interface:: later in this chapter.

10.3 Functionality and associated key sequences (bindings)
==========================================================

The following sections summarize the capabilities of the Ciao emacs
interface and the (default) _key sequences_ used to access those
capabilities. Most of these functions are accessible also from the
menu bar.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Syntax coloring and syntax-based editing,  Next: Getting on-line help,  Prev: Functionality and associated key sequences (bindings),  Up: Using Ciao inside GNU emacs

10.4 Syntax coloring and syntax-based editing
=============================================

Syntax-based highlighting (coloring) of code is provided
automatically when opening Ciao files. This includes also the
assertions used by the preprocessor and the documentation strings
used by the Ciao auto-documenter, `lpdoc'. The mode should be set to
Ciao and the Ciao mode menus should appear on the menu bar. The
colors and fonts used can be changed through the _customize_ options
in the help menu (see *note Customization::).

   During editing this coloring may be refreshed by calling the
appropriate function (see below).

   Limited syntax-based auto-indentation and auto-fill of code and
comments is also provided. Syntax highlighting and coloring is also
available for the error and warning messages produced by the top
level, preprocessor, and auto-documenter, and, in general, for the
output produced by these tools.

Commands:

<C-c> <h>
     Undate (recompute) syntax-based highlighting (coloring).

<TAB>
     Indent current line as Ciao code. With argument, indent any
     additional lines of the same clause rigidly along with this one.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Getting on-line help,  Next: Loading and compiling programs,  Prev: Syntax coloring and syntax-based editing,  Up: Using Ciao inside GNU emacs

10.5 Getting on-line help
=========================

The following commands are useful for getting on-line help. This is
done by accessing the `info' version of the Ciao manuals or the `emacs'
built-in help strings. Note also that the `info' standard `search'
command (generally bound to <s>) can be used inside `info' buffers to
search for a given string.

<C-c> <TAB>
     Find help for the symbol (e.g., predicate, directive,
     declaration, type, etc.) that is currently under the cursor.
     Opens a (hopefully) relevant part of the Ciao manuals in `info'
     mode. Requires that the Ciao manuals in `info' format be
     installed and accessible to `emacs' (i.e., they should appear
     somewhere in the info directory when typing `M-x info'). It also
     requires `word-help.el', which is provided with Ciao. Refer to
     the installation instructions if this is not the case.

<C-c> </>
     Find a completion for the symbol (e.g., predicate, directive,
     declaration, type, etc.) that is currently under the cursor.
     Uses for completion the contents of the indices of the Ciao
     manuals. Same requirements as for finding help for the symbol.

<C-c> <RET>
     Go to the part of the info directory containing the Ciao manuals.

<C-h> <m>
     Show a short description of the Ciao emacs mode, including all
     key bindings.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Loading and compiling programs,  Next: Commands available in toplevel and preprocessor buffers,  Prev: Getting on-line help,  Up: Using Ciao inside GNU emacs

10.6 Loading and compiling programs
===================================

These commands allow _loading programs_, _creating executables_, etc.
by issuing the appropriate commands to a Ciao top level shell,
running in its own buffer as a subprocess. See *note The interactive
top-level shell:: for details. The following commands implement the
communication with the Ciao top level:

<C-c> <t>
     Ensure that an inferior Ciao top-level process is running.

     This opens a top-level window (if one did not exist already)
     where queries can be input directly. Programs can be loaded into
     this top level by typing the corresponding commands in this
     window (such as use_module, etc.), or, more typically, by
     opening the file to be loaded in an emacs window (where it can
     be edited) and issuing a load command (such as C-c l or C-c L)
     directly from there (see the loading commands of this mode and
     their bindings).

     Note that many useful commands (e.g., to repeat and edit
     previous commands, interrupt jobs, locate errors, automatic
     completions, etc.) are available in this top-level window (see
     *note Commands available in toplevel and preprocessor buffers::).

     Often, it is not necessary to use this function since execution
     of any of the other functions related to the top level (e.g.,
     loading buffers into the top level) ensures that a top level is
     started (starting one if required).

<C-c> <l>
     Load the current buffer (and any auxiliary files it may use)
     into the top level.

     The type of compilation performed ( _compiling_ or _interpreting_)
     is selected automatically depending on whether the buffer has
     been marked for debugging or not - see below. In case you try to
     load a file while in the middle of the debugging process the
     debugger is first aborted and then the buffer is loaded. Also,
     if there is a defined query, the user is asked whether it should
     be called.

<C-c> <f>
     Load CiaoPP and then the current buffer (and any auxiliary files
     it may use) into the top level. Use CiaoPP auto_check_assrt
     predicate to check current buffer assertions and then load the
     buffer if there was no error.

<C-c> <x>
     Make an executable from the code in the current buffer. The
     buffer must contain a `main/0' or `main/1' predicate. Note that
     compiler options can be set to determine whether the libraries
     and auxiliary files used by the executable will be statically
     linked, dynamically linked, auto-loaded, etc.

<C-c> <o>
     Make a Ciao object (.po) file from the code in the current
     buffer. This is useful for example while debugging during
     development of a very large application which is compiled into
     an excutable, and only one or a few files are modified. If the
     application executable is dynamically linked, i.e., the
     component .po files are loaded dynamically during startup of the
     application, then this command can be used to recompile only the
     file or files which have changed, and the correct version will
     be loaded dynamically the next time the application is started.
     However, note that this must be done with care since it only
     works if the inter-module interfaces have not changed. The
     recommended, much safer way is to generate the executable again,
     letting the Ciao compiler, which is inherently incremental,
     determine what needs to be recompiled.

<C-c> <a>
     Make an active module executable from the code in the current
     buffer. An active module is a remote procedure call server (see
     the `activemod' library documentation for details).

<C-c> <s>
     Set the current buffer as the principal file in a multiple
     module programming environment.

<C-c> <L>
     Load the module designated as _main module_ (and all related
     files that it uses) into the top level. If no main module is
     defined it will load the current buffer.

     The type of compilation performed ( _compiling_ or _interpreting_)
     is selected automatically depending on whether the buffer has
     been marked for debugging or not - see below. In case you try to
     load a file while in the middle of the debugging process the
     debugger is first aborted and then the buffer is loaded. Also,
     if there is a defined query, the user is asked whether is should
     be called.

<C-c> <q>
     Set a default query. This may be useful specially during
     debugging sessions. However, as mentioned elsewhere, note that
     commands that repeat previous queries are also available.

     This query can be recalled at any time using C-c Q. It is also
     possible to set things up so that this query will be issued
     automatically any time a program is (re)loaded. The
     functionality is available in the major mode (i.e., from a
     buffer containing a source file) and in the inferior mode (i.e.,
     from the buffer running the top-level shell). When called from
     the major mode (i.e., from window containing a source file) then
     the user is prompted in the minibuffer for the query. When
     called from the inferior mode (i.e., from a top-level window)
     then the query on the current line, following the Ciao prompt,
     is taken as the default query.

     To clear the default query use M-x ciao-clear-query or simply
     set it to an empty query: i.e., in a source buffer select C-c q
     and enter an empty query. In an inferior mode simply select C-c
     q on a line that contains only the system prompt.

<C-c> <Q>
     Issue predefined query.

10.7 Commands available in toplevel and preprocessor buffers
============================================================

The interactive top level and the preprocessor both are typically run
in an iteractive buffer, in which it is possible to communicate with
them in the same way as if they had been started from a standard
shell. These interactive buffers run in the so-called _Ciao inferior
mode_. This is a particular version of the standard emacs shell
package (comint) and thus all the commands typically available when
running shells inside emacs also work in these buffers. In addition,
many of the commands and key bindings available in buffers containing
Ciao source code are also available in these interactive buffers,
when applicable. The Ciao-specific commands available include:

<C-c> <TAB>
     Find help for the symbol (e.g., predicate, directive,
     declaration, type, etc.) that is currently under the cursor.
     Opens a (hopefully) relevant part of the Ciao manuals in `info'
     mode. Requires that the Ciao manuals in `info' format be
     installed and accessible to `emacs' (i.e., they should appear
     somewhere in the info directory when typing `M-x info'). It also
     requires `word-help.el', which is provided with Ciao. Refer to
     the installation instructions if this is not the case.

<C-c> </>
     Find a completion for the symbol (e.g., predicate, directive,
     declaration, type, etc.) that is currently under the cursor.
     Uses for completion the contents of the indices of the Ciao
     manuals. Same requirements as for finding help for the symbol.

<C-c> <`>
     Go to the location in the source file containing the next error
     reported by the last Ciao subprocess (preprocessor or toplevel)
     which was run.

<C-c> <e>
     Remove error marks from last run (and also debugging marks if
     present).

<C-c> <q>
     Set a default query. This may be useful specially during
     debugging sessions. However, as mentioned elsewhere, note that
     commands that repeat previous queries are also available.

     This query can be recalled at any time using C-c Q. It is also
     possible to set things up so that this query will be issued
     automatically any time a program is (re)loaded. The
     functionality is available in the major mode (i.e., from a
     buffer containing a source file) and in the inferior mode (i.e.,
     from the buffer running the top-level shell). When called from
     the major mode (i.e., from window containing a source file) then
     the user is prompted in the minibuffer for the query. When
     called from the inferior mode (i.e., from a top-level window)
     then the query on the current line, following the Ciao prompt,
     is taken as the default query.

     To clear the default query use M-x ciao-clear-query or simply
     set it to an empty query: i.e., in a source buffer select C-c q
     and enter an empty query. In an inferior mode simply select C-c
     q on a line that contains only the system prompt.

<C-c> <Q>
     Issue predefined query.

<C-c> <C-v>
     Show last output file produced by Ciao preprocessor. The
     preprocessor works by producing a file which is a transformed
     and/or adorned (with assertions) version of the input file. This
     command is often used after running the preprocessor in order to
     visit the output file and see the results from running the
     preprocessor.

<C-c> <v>
     Report the version of the emacs Ciao mode.

The following are some of the commands from the comint shell package
which may be specially useful (type `<f1> m' while in a Ciao
interactive buffer for a complete list of commands):

<M-p>
     Cycle backwards through input history, saving input.

     (fn ARG)

<M-n>
     Cycle forwards through input history.

     (fn ARG)

<M-x> ` comint-previous-matching-input'
     Search backwards through input history for match for REGEXP.
     (Previous history elements are earlier commands.) With prefix
     argument N, search for Nth previous match. If N is negative,
     find the next or Nth next match.

     (fn REGEXP N)

<TAB>
     Dynamically find completion of the item at point. Note that this
     completion command refers generally to filenames (rather than,
     e.g., predicate names, as in the previous functions).

<M-?>
     List all (filename) completions of the item at point.

<RET>
     Return at any point of the a line at the end of a buffer sends
     that line as input. Return not at end copies the rest of the
     current line to the end of the buffer and sends it as input.

<^D>
     Delete ARG characters forward or send an EOF to subprocess.
     Sends an EOF only if point is at the end of the buffer and there
     is no input.

     (fn ARG)

<^C> <^U>
     Kill all text from last stuff output by interpreter to point.

     (fn)

<^C> <^W>
     Kill characters backward until encountering the beginning of a
     word. With argument ARG, do this that many times.

<^C> <^C>
     Interrupt the current subjob. This command also kills the
     pending input between the process mark and point.

     (fn)

<^C> <^Z>
     Stop the current subjob. This command also kills the pending
     input between the process mark and point.

     WARNING: if there is no current subjob, you can end up
     suspending the top-level process running in the buffer. If you
     accidentally do this, use M-x comint-continue-subjob to resume
     the process. (This is not a problem with most shells, since they
     ignore this signal.)

     (fn)

<^C> <^\>
     Send quit signal to the current subjob. This command also kills
     the pending input between the process mark and point.

     (fn)

10.8 Locating errors and checking the syntax of assertions
==========================================================

These commands allow locating quickly the point in the source code
corresponding to errors flagged by the compiler or preprocessor as
well as performing several syntactic checks of assertions: 

<C-c> <`>
     Go to the location in the source file containing the next error
     reported by the last Ciao subprocess (preprocessor or toplevel)
     which was run.

<C-c> <e>
     Remove error marks from last run (and also debugging marks if
     present).

<C-c> <E>
     Check the _syntax_ of the code and assertions in the current
     buffer, as well as imports and exports. This uses the standard
     top level (i.e., does not call the preprocessor and thus does
     not require the preprocessor to be installed). Note that full
     (semantic) assertion checking must be done with the preprocessor.

10.9 Commands which help typing in programs
===========================================

The following commands are intended to help in the process of writing
programs: 

<C-c> <I> <S>
     Insert a (Unix) header at the top of the current buffer so that
     the Ciao script interpreter will be called on this file if _run_
     from the command line. It also makes the file "executable"
     (e.g., '`chmod +x <file>'' in Unix). See *note The script
     interpreter:: for details.

<C-c> <i>
     Indent a Ciao or Prolog file.

10.10 Debugging programs
========================

These commands allow marking modules for _debugging_ by issuing the
appropiate commands to a Ciao top level shell, running in its own
buffer as a subprocess. There are two differents types of debugging:
traditional debugging (using the byrd-box model and spy-points) and _source-level
debugging_ (same as traditional debugging plus source tracing and breakpoints).  In
order to use _breakpoints_, source debugging must be on. The
following commands implement comunication with the Ciao top level:

<C-c> <d>
     Debug (or stop debugging) buffer source. This is a shortcut
     which is particularly useful when using the source debugger on a
     single module. It corresponds to several lower-level actions.
     Those lower-level actions depend on how the module was selected
     for debugging. In case the module was not marked for
     source-level debugging, it marks the module corresponding to the
     current buffer for source-level debugging, reloads it to make
     sure that it is loaded in the correct way for debugging (same as
     C-c l), and sets the debugger in trace mode (i.e., issues the
     `trace.' command to the top-level shell). Conversely, if the
     module was already marked for source-level debugging then it
     will take the opposite actions, i.e., it unmarks the module for
     source-level debugging, reloads it, and sets the debugger to
     non-debug mode.

<C-c> <m>
     Mark, or unmark, the current buffer for debugging (traditional
     debugging or source debugging). Note that if the buffer has
     already been loaded while it was unmarked for debugging (and has
     therefore been loaded in "compile" mode) it has to be loaded
     again. The minibuffer shows how the module is loaded now and
     allows selecting another mode for it. There are three
     posibilities: N for no debug, S for source debug and D for
     traditional debug.

<C-c> <M-m>
     Visits all Ciao files which are currently open in a buffer
     allowing selecting for each of them whether to debug them or not
     and the type of debugging performed. When working on a multiple
     module program, it is possible to have many modules open at a
     time. In this case, you will navigate through all open Ciao
     files and select the debug mode for each of them (same as doing
     C-c m for each).

<C-c> <S> <b>
     Set a breakpoint on the current literal (goal). This can be done
     at any time (while debugging or not). The cursor must be _on the
     predicate symbol of the literal_. Breakpoints are only useful
     when using source-level debugging.

<C-c> <S> <v>
     Remove a breakpoint from the current literal (goal). This can be
     done at any time (while debugging or not). The cursor must be
     _on the predicate symbol of the literal_.

<C-c> <S> <n>
     Remove all breakpoints. This can be done at any time (while
     debugging or not).

<C-c> <S> <l>
     Redisplay breakpoints in all Ciao buffers. This ensures that the
     marks in the source files and the Ciao toplevel are synchronized.

<C-c> <S> <r>
     Remove breakpoint coloring in all Ciao files.

<C-c> <S> <t>
     Set the debugger to the trace state. In this state, the program
     is executed step by step.

<C-c> <S> <d>
     Set the debugger to the debug state. In this state, the program
     will only stop in breakpoints and spypoints. Breakpoints are
     specially supported in `emacs' and using source debug.

<C-c> <r>
     Load the current region (between the cursor and a previous mark)
     into the top level. Since loading a region of a file is
     typically done for debugging and/or testing purposes, this
     command always loads the region in debugging mode (interpreted).

<C-c> <p>
     Load the predicate around the cursor into the top level. Since
     loading a single predicate is typically done for debugging
     and/or testing purposes, this command always loads the predicate
     in debugging mode (interpreted).

<C-c> <u>
     Run the test over the current buffer.

     The test should be specified using a test assertion in the
     module.

10.11 Preprocessing programs
============================

These commands allow _preprocessing programs_ with `ciaopp', the _Ciao
preprocessor_.

   See the preprocessor manual for details. The following commands
implement the communication with the Ciao preprocessor:

<C-c> <A>
     Call the preprocessor to perform a number of pre-selected
     analyses on the current buffer (and related modules).

<C-c> <T>
     Call the preprocessor to perform compile-time checking of the
     assertions (types, modes, determinacy, nonfailure, cost, ...) in
     the current buffer (and against those in related modules).

<C-c> <O>
     Uses the preprocessor to perform optimizations (partial
     evaluation, abstract specialization, parallelization, ...) on
     the current buffer (and related modules).

<C-c> <M>
     Browse and select (using the preprocessor menus) the actions to
     be performed by the preprocessor when performing analisys used
     by M-x ciao- C-c A, C-c T, C-c O, and the corresponding toolbar
     buttons.

<C-c> <C-v>
     Show last output file produced by Ciao preprocessor. The
     preprocessor works by producing a file which is a transformed
     and/or adorned (with assertions) version of the input file. This
     command is often used after running the preprocessor in order to
     visit the output file and see the results from running the
     preprocessor.

<C-c> <C-r>
     Ensure that an inferior Ciao preprocessor process is running.

     This opens a preprocessor top-level window (if one did not exist
     already) where preprocessing commands and preprocessing menu
     options can be input directly. Programs can be preprocessed by
     typing commands in this window, or, more typically, by opening
     the file to be preprocessed in an emacs window (where it can be
     edited) and issuing a command (such as C-c A, C-c T, C-c O, or
     C-c M) directly from there (see the preprocessing commands of
     this mode and their bindings).

     Note that many useful commands (e.g., to repeat and edit
     previous commands, interrupt jobs, locate errors, automatic
     completions, etc.) are available in this top-level window (see
     *note Commands available in toplevel and preprocessor buffers::).

     Often, it is not necessary to use this function since execution
     of any of the other functions related to the top level (e.g.,
     loading buffers into the top level) ensures that a top level is
     started (starting one if required).


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Version control,  Next: Generating program documentation,  Prev: Preprocessing programs,  Up: Using Ciao inside GNU emacs

10.12 Version control
=====================

The following commands can be used to carry out a simple but
effective form of version control by keeping a log of changes on a
file or a group of related files. Interestingly, this log is kept in
a format that is understood by `lpdoc', the Ciao documenter [Her99].
As a result, if these version comments are present, then `lpdoc' will
be able to automatically assign up to date version numbers to the
manuals that it generates. This way it is always possible to identify
to which version of the software a manual corresponds. Also, `lpdoc'
can create automatically sections describing the changes made since
previous versions, which are extracted from the comments in the
changelog entries.

   The main effect of these commands is to automatically associate
the following information to a set of changes performed in the file
and/or in a set of related files:

   * a _version number_ (such as, e.g., `1.2', where `1' is the major
     version number and `2' is the minor version number),

   * a patch number (such as, e.g., the `4' in `1.2#4'),

   * a time stamp (such as, e.g., `1998/12/14,17:20*28+MET'),

   * the author of the change, and

   * a comment explaining the change.  

   The version numbering used can be local to a single file or common
to a number of related files. A simple version numbering policy is
implemented: when a relevant change is made, the user typically
inserts a changelog entry for it, using the appropriate command (or
selecting the corresponding option when prompted while saving a
file). This will cause the _patch number_ for the file (or for the
whole system that the file is part of) to be incremented
automatically and the corresponding machine-readable comment to be
inserted in the file. Major and minor version numbers can also be
changed, but this is always invoked by hand (see below).

   The changelog entry is written in the form of a `comment/2'
declaration. As mentioned before, the advantage of using this kind of
changelog entries is that these declarations can be processed by the `lpdoc'
automatic documenter (see the `lpdoc' reference manual [Her99] or the `assertions'
library documentation for more details on these declarations).

   Whether the user is asked or not to introduce such changelog
entries, and how the patch and version numbers should be increased is
controlled by the presence in the file of a `comment/2' declaration
of the type:

   `:- doc(version_maintenance,<type>).'

(note that this requires including the `assertions' library in the
source file). These declarations themselves are also typically
introduced automatically when using this mode (see below).

   The version maintenance mode can also be set alternatively by
inserting a comment such as:

     %% Local Variables:
     %% mode: ciao
     %% update-version-comments: "off"
     %% End:

   The lines above instruct emacs to put the buffer visiting the file
in emacs Ciao mode and to turn version maintenance off. Setting the
version maintenance mode in this way has the disadvantage that `lpdoc',
the auto-documenter, and other related tools will not be aware of the
type of version maintenance being performed (the lines above are
comments for Ciao). However, this can be useful in fact for setting
the _version maintenance mode for packages_ and other files meant for
inclusion in other files, since that way the settings will not affect
the file in which the package is included.

   The following commands implement the version control support:

<C-c> <C-a>
     Used to turn on or off version control for the file being
     visited in the current buffer. The user will be prompted to
     choose among the following options:

    <y>
          Turn version control on for this file.

    <n>
          Turn version control off for this file. A version control
          comment such as:

          `:- doc(version_maintenance,off).'

          will be added to the buffer and the file saved. No version
          control will be performed on this file until the line above
          is removed or modified (i.e., from now on C-x C-s simply
          saves the buffer).

    <q>
          Turn off prompting for the introduction of changelog
          entries for now.  `emacs' will not ask again while the
          buffer is loaded, but it may ask again when saving after
          the next time you load the buffer (if
          `ciao-ask-for-version-maintenance-type' is set to `yes').


     If <y> is selected, then the system prompts again regarding how
     and where the version and patch number information is to be
     maintained. The following options are available:

    `on'
          All version control information will be contained within
          this file. When saving a buffer (C-x C-s) emacs will ask if
          a changelog entry should be added to the file before
          saving. If a comment is entered by the user, a new patch
          number is assigned to it and the comment is added to the
          file. This patch number will be the one that follows the
          most recent changelog entry already in the file. This is
          obviously useful when maintaining version numbers
          individually for each file.

    `<directory_name>'
          Global version control will be performed coherently on
          several files. When saving a buffer (C-x C-s) emacs will
          ask if a changelog entry should be added to the file before
          saving. If a comment is given, the global patch number
          (which will be kept in the file:
          `<directory_name>/GlobalPatch') is atomically incremented
          and the changelog entry is added to the current file,
          associated to that patch number. Also, a small entry is
          added to a file `<directory_name>/GlobalChangeLog' which
          points to the current file. This allows inspecting all
          changes sequentially by visiting all the files where the
          changes were made (see C-c C-n). This is obviously useful
          when maintaining a single thread of version and patch
          numbers for a set of files.

    `off'
          Turns off version control: C-x C-s then simply saves the
          file as usual.


     *Some useful tips:*

        * If a changelog entry is in fact introduced, the cursor is
          left at the point in the file where the comment was
          inserted and the mark is left at the original file point.
          This allows inspecting (and possibly modifying) the
          changelog entry, and then returning to the original point
          in the file by simply typing C-x C-x.

        * The first changelog entry is entered by default at the end
          of the buffer. Later, the changelog entries can be moved
          anywhere else in the file. New changelog entries are always
          inserted just above the first changelog entry which appears
          in the file.

        * The comments in changelog entries can be edited at any time.

        * If a changelog entry is moved to another file, and version
          numbers are shared by several files through a directory,
          the corresponding file pointer in the
          `<directory_name>/GlobalChangeLog' file needs to be changed
          also, for the entry to be locatable later using C-c C-n.



<C-x> <C-s>
     This is the standard `emacs' command that saves a buffer by
     writing the contents into the associated `.pl' file. However, in
     the Ciao mode, if version control is set to on for ths file,
     then this command will ask the user before saving whether to
     introduce a changelog entry documenting the changes performed.

     In addition, if:

        * the buffer does not already contain a comment specifying the type
          of version control to be performed,

        * and the customizable variable
          `ciao-ask-for-version-maintenance-type' is set to `yes' (go
          to the Ciao options menu, LPdoc area to change this, which
          is by default set to `no'),


     then, before saving a buffer, the user will be also
     automatically asked to choose which kind of version control is
     desired for the file, as in C-c C-a.


<C-c> <C-s>
     Same as C-x C-s except that it forces prompting for inclusion of
     a changelog entry even if the buffer is unmodified.

<C-c> <n>
     Force a move to a new major/minor version number (the user will
     be prompted for the new numbers). Only applicable if using
     directory-based version maintenance. Note that otherwise it
     suffices with introducing a changelog entry in the file and
     changing its version number by hand.

<C-c> <C-n>
     When a unique version numbering is being maintained across
     several files, this command allows inspecting all changes
     sequentially by visiting all the files in which the changes were
     made:

        * If in a source file, find the next changelog entry in the
          source file, open in another window the corresponding `GlobalChangeLog'
          file, and position the cursor at the corresponding entry.
          This allows browsing the previous and following changes
          made, which may perhaps reside in other files in the system.

        * If in a `GlobalChangeLog' file, look for the next entry in
          the file, and open in another window the source file in
          which the corresponding comment resides, positioning the
          corresponding comment at the top of the screen. This allows
          going through a section of the `GlobalChangeLog' file
          checking all the corresponding comments in the different
          files in which they occur.

10.13 Generating program documentation
======================================

These commands provide some bindings and facilities for generating
and viewing the documentation corresponding to the current buffer.
The documentation is generated in a temporary directory, which is
created automatically. This is quite useful while modifying the
documentation for a file, in order to check the output that will be
produced, whithout having to set up a documentation directory by hand
or to regenerate a large manual of which the file may be a part.

<C-c> <D> <B>
     Generate the documentation for the current buffer in the default
     format. This allows generating a simple document for the current
     buffer. Basically, it creates a simple, default `SETTINGS.pl'
     file, sets `mainfile' in `SETTINGS.pl' to the current buffer and
     then generates the documentation in a temporary directory. This
     is useful for seeing how the documentation of a file will
     format. Note that for generating manuals the best approach is to
     set up a permanent documentation directory with the appropriate
     `SETTINGS.pl' file (see the LPdoc manual).

<C-c> <D> <F>
     Change the default output format used by the LPdoc
     auto-documenter. It is set by default to `html' or to the
     environment variable `LPDOCFORMAT' if it is defined.  

<C-c> <D> <S>
     Visit, or create, the default `SETTINGS.pl' file (which controls
     all auto-documenter options).

<C-c> <D> <G>
     Generate the documentation according to `SETTINGS.pl' in the
     default format. This allows generating complex documents but it
     assumes that `SETTINGS.pl' exists and that the options that it
     contains (main file, component files, paths, etc.) have been set
     properly. Documentation is generated in a temporary directory.
     Note however that for generating complex manuals the best
     approach is to set up a permanent documentation directory with
     the appropriate `SETTINGS.pl' and `Makefile' files (see the
     LPdoc manual).

<C-c> <D> <V>
     Start a viewer on the documentation for the current buffer in
     the default format.

<C-c> <D> <W>
     Change the root working dir used by the LPdoc auto-documenter.
     It is set by default to a new dir under `/tmp' or to the
     environment variable `LPDOCWDIR' if it is defined.

10.14 Setting top level preprocessor and documenter executables
===============================================================

These commands allow _changing the executables used_ when starting
the top-level, the preprocessor, or the auto-documenter. They also
allow changing the arguments that these executables take, and
changing the path where the libraries reside. In the case of the
top-level and preprocessor, this should be done only by users which
understand the implications, but it is very useful if several
versions of Ciao or the preprocessor are available in the system. All
these settings can be changed through the _customize_ options in the
help menu (see *note Customization::).

<C-c> <S> <A>

<C-c> <S> <C>
     Change the Ciao executable used to run the top level. It is set
     by default to `ciao' or, to the environment variable `CIAO' if
     it is defined.  

<C-c> <S> <C-c>
     Change the arguments passed to the Ciao executable. They are set
     by default to none or, to the environment variable `CIAOARGS' if
     it is defined.  

<C-c> <S> <P>
     Change the executable used to run the Ciao Preprocessor
     toplevel. It is set by default to `ciaopp' or, to the
     environment variable `CIAOPP' if it is defined.  

<C-c> <S> <C-p>
     Change the arguments passed to the Ciao preprocessor executable.
     They are set by default to none or to the environment variable
     `CIAOPPARGS' if it is defined.  

<C-c> <S> <L>
     Change the location of the Ciao library paths (changes the
     environment variable `CIAOLIB').

<C-c> <S> <D>
     Change the executable used to run the LPdoc auto-documenter. It
     is set by default to `lpdoc' or to the environment variable
     `LPDOC' if it is defined.  

<C-c> <S> <C-d>
     Change the arguments passed to the LPdoc auto-documenter. They
     are set by default to none or to the environment variable
     `LPDOCARGS' if it is defined.  

<C-c> <S> <C-l>
     Change the path in which the LPdoc library is installed. It is
     set by default to `/home/clip/lib' or to the environment
     variable `LPDOCLIB' if it is defined.

10.16 Traditional Prolog Mode Commands
======================================

These commands provide some bindings and facilities for loading
programs, which are present in emacs Prolog modes of traditional
Prolog systems (e.g., SICStus). This is useful mainly if the Ciao
emacs mode is used with such Prolog systems. Note that these commands
( `compile/1' and `consult/1') are deprecated in Ciao (due to the
more advanced, separate compilation model in Ciao) and their use in
the Ciao top-level is not recommended.

<C-c> <K>
     Compile the entire buffer.

<C-c> <k>
     Compile a given region.

<C-c> <C-k>
     Compile the predicate around point.

<C-c> <C>
     Consult the entire buffer.

<C-c> <c>
     Consult a given region.

<C-c> <C-c>
     Consult the predicate around point.

10.17 Coexistence with other Prolog-like interfaces
===================================================

As mentioned previously, the Ciao `emacs' interface can also be used
to work with traditional Prolog or CLP systems. Also, the Ciao `emacs'
interface (_mode_) can coexist with other Prolog-related `emacs'
interfaces (_modes_) (such as, e.g., the `SICStus' Prolog interface).
Only one of the interfaces can be active at a time for a given buffer
(i.e., for each given file opened inside `emacs'). In order the
change a buffer to a given interface, move the cursor to that buffer
and type `M-x ...-mode' (e.g., for the Ciao mode, `M-x ciao-mode').

   If several Prolog-related `emacs' interfaces are loaded, then
typically the _last_ one to be loaded takes precedence, in the sense
that this will be the interface in which `emacs' will be set when
opening files which have a `.pl' ending (this depends a bit on how
things are set up in your `.emacs' file).

10.19 Using Ciao mode capabilities in standard shells
=====================================================

The capabilities (commands, coloring, error location, ...) which are
active in the Ciao _inferior_ mode can also be made available in any
standard command line shell which is being run within emacs. This can
be enabled by going to the buffer in which the shell is running and
typing "<M-x> `ciao-inferior-mode'". This is very useful for example
when running the stand-alone compiler, the `lpdoc' auto-documenter,
or even certain user applications (those that use the standard error
message library) in an emacs sub-shell. Turning the Ciao inferior
mode on on that sub-shell will highlight and color the error
messages, and automatically find and visit the locations in the files
in which the errors are reported.

   Finally, one the most useful applications of this is when using the embedded
debugger (a version of the debugger which can be embedded into
executables so that an interactive debugging session can be triggered
at any time while running that executable without needing the
top-level shell). If an application is run in a shell buffer which
has been set with Ciao inferior mode (<M-x> `ciao-inferior-mode') and
this application starts emitting output from the embedded debugger
(i.e., which contains the embedded debugger and is debugging its
code) then the Ciao emacs mode will be able to follow these messages,
for example tracking execution in the source level code. This also
works if the application is written in a combination of languages,
provided the parts written in Ciao are compiled with the embedded
debugger package and is thus a covenient way of debugging
multi-language applications. The only thing needed is to make sure
that the output messages appear in a shell buffer that is in Ciao
inferior mode.

10.20 Customization
===================

This section explains all variables used in the Ciao emacs mode which
can be customized by users. Such customization can be performed (in
later versions of `emacs') from the `emacs' menus (`Help -> Customize
-> Top-level Customization Group'), or also by adding a `setq'
expression in the `.emacs' file. Such `setq' expression should be
similar to:

   `(setq <variable> <new_value>)'

The following sections list the different variables which can be
customized for `ciao', `ciaopp' and `lpdoc'.

* Ciao general variables::
* CiaoPP variables::
* LPdoc variables::
* Faces used in syntax-based highlighting (coloring)::

10.20.1 Ciao general variables
------------------------------

`ciao-ask-for-version-maintenance-type' (_string_)
     If turned to yes the system asks prompts to set version control
     when saving files that do not set a version control system
     explicitly within the file.

`ciao-clip-logo' (_file_)
     CLIP logo image.

`ciao-create-sample-file-on-startup' (_boolean_)
     When starting the Ciao environment using ciao-startup two
     buffers are opened: one with a toplevel and another with a
     sample file. This toggle controls whether the sample file, meant
     for novice users, is created or not. Set by default, non-novice
     users will probably want to turn it off.

`ciao-first-indent-width' (_integer_)
     First level indentation for a new goal.

`ciao-indent-width' (_integer_)
     Indentation for a new goal.

`ciao-inhibit-toolbar' (_boolean_)
     *Non-nil means don't use the specialized Ciao toolbar.

`ciao-library-path' (_string_)
     Path to the Ciao System libraries (reads/sets the CIAOLIB
     environment variable ). Typically left empty, since ciao
     executables know which library to use.

`ciao-locate-also-note-messages' (_boolean_)
     If set, also when errors of type NOTE are detected the
     corresponding file is visited and the location marked. It is set
     to nil by default because sometimes the user prefers not to take
     any action with respect to these messages (for example, many
     come from the documenter, indicating that adding certain
     declarations the documentation would be improved).

`ciao-locate-errors-after-run' (_boolean_)
     If set, location of any errors produced when running Ciao tools
     (loading or preprocessing code, running the documenter, etc.)
     will be initiated automatically. I.e., after running a command,
     the system will automatically highlight any error messages and
     the corresponding areas in source files if possible. If set to
     nil this location will only happen after typing C-c ` or
     accessing the corresponding menu or tool bar button.

`ciao-logo' (_file_)
     Ciao logo image.

`ciao-main-filename' (_string_)
     Name of main file in a multiple module program. Setting thsi is
     very useful when working on a multi-module program because it
     allows issuing a load command after working on an inferior
     module which will reload from the main module, thus also
     reloading automatically all dependent modules.

`ciao-os-shell-prompt-pattern' (_string_)
     Regular expression used to describe the shell prompt pattern, so
     that error location works in inferior shells. This is useful for
     example so that errors are located when generating
     documentation, and also when using the embedded debugger or any
     other application in a shell. It is best to be as precise as
     possible when defining this so that the standard Ciao error
     location does not get confused.

`ciao-query' (_string_)
     Query to use in Ciao. Setting this is useful when using a long
     or complicated query because it saves from having to type it
     over and over again. It is possible to set that this query will
     be issued any time a program is (re)loaded.

`ciao-system' (_string_)
     Name of Ciao executable which runs the classical top level.

`ciao-system-args' (_string_)
     Arguments passed to Ciao toplevel executable.

`ciao-toplevel-buffer-name' (_string_)
     Basic name of the buffer running the Ciao toplevel inferior
     process.

`ciao-user-directives' (_list_)
     List of identifiers of any directives defined by users which you
     would like highlighted (colored). Be careful, since wrong
     entries may affect other syntax highlighting.

10.20.2 CiaoPP variables
------------------------

`ciao-ciaopp-buffer-name' (_string_)
     Basic name of the buffer running the Ciao preprocessor inferior
     process.

`ciao-ciaopp-gmenu-buffer-name' (_string_)
     Basic name of the buffer running the Ciao preprocessor graphical
     menu interface.

`ciao-ciaopp-system' (_string_)
     Name of Ciao preprocessor executable.

`ciao-ciaopp-system-args' (_string_)
     Arguments passed to Ciao preprocessor executable.

`ciao-ciaopp-use-graphical-menu' (_boolean_)
     If set, an interactive graphical menu is used for controlling
     CiaoPP, instead of asking ascii questions in the CiaoPP buffer.

`ciao-lpdoc-buffer-name' (_string_)
     Basic name of the buffer running the auto-documenter inferior
     process.

`ciao-lpdoc-docformat' (_symbol_)
     Name of default output format used by LPdoc.

`ciao-lpdoc-libpath' (_directory_)
     Path in which the LPdoc library is installed.

`ciao-lpdoc-system' (_string_)
     Name of LPdoc auto-documenter executable.

`ciao-lpdoc-system-args' (_string_)
     Arguments passed to LPdoc executable.

`ciao-lpdoc-wdir-root' (_directory_)
     Name of root working dir used by LPdoc.

`ciao-face-fontify-sectioning' (_symbol_)
     Whether to fontify sectioning macros with varying height or a
     color face.

     If it is a number, use varying height faces. The number is used
     for scaling starting from `ciao-face-sectioning-5-face'.
     Typically values from 1.05 to 1.3 give best results, depending
     on your font setup. If it is the symbol `color', use
     `font-lock-type-face'.

     Caveats: Customizing the scaling factor applies to all
     sectioning faces unless those face have been saved by customize.
     Setting this variable directly does not take effect unless you
     call `ciao-face-update-sectioning-faces' or restart Emacs.

     Switching from `color' to a number or vice versa does not take
     effect unless you call M-x font-lock-fontify-buffer or restart
     Emacs.

     the variable `ciao-face-fontify-sectioning'.

`ciao-face-sectioning-1-face' (_face_)
     Face for sectioning commands at level 1.

     Probably you don't want to customize this face directly. Better
     change the base face `ciao-face-sectioning-5-face' or customize

`ciao-face-sectioning-2-face' (_face_)
     Face for sectioning commands at level 2.

     Probably you don't want to customize this face directly. Better

10.21 Installation of the Ciao emacs interface
==============================================

If opening a file ending with `.pl' puts emacs in another mode (such
as `perl' mode, which is the -arguably incorrect- default setting in
some `emacs' distributions), then either the emacs mode was not
installed or the installation settings are being overwritten by other
settings in your `.emacs' file or in some library. In any case, you
can set things manually so that the Ciao mode is loaded by default in
your system. This can be done by including in your `.emacs' file a
line such as:

   `(load <CIAOLIBDIR>/ciao-mode-init)'

This loads the above mentioned file from the Ciao library, which
contains the following lines (except that the paths are changed
during installation to appropriate values for your system):

     ; -*- mode: emacs-lisp; -*-
     ;;
     ;; Ciao/Prolog mode initialization
     ;; -------------------------------
     ;; (can normally be used with other Prolog modes and the default prolog.el)
     ;;
     (setq load-path (cons <v>CIAOLIBDIR</v> load-path))
     ;; Java mode in ciao
     (setq load-path
        (cons <v>CIAOLIBDIR</v> load-path))
     (defun load-java-ciaopp-mode ()
       (require 'java-ciaopp)
       (java-ciaopp-setup))
     (add-hook 'java-mode-hook 'load-java-ciaopp-mode)

     (autoload 'run-ciao-toplevel "ciao"
               "Start a Ciao/Prolog top-level sub-process." t)
     (autoload 'ciao-startup "ciao"
               "The Ciao/Prolog program development system startup screens." t)
     (autoload 'ciao "ciao"

     (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.pls$" . ciao-mode) auto-mode-alist))
     (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.lpdoc$" . ciao-mode) auto-mode-alist))
     (setq completion-ignored-extensions
           (append '(".dep" ".itf" ".po" ".asr" ".cpx")
                   completion-ignored-extensions))
     ;; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     ;; In Un*x, the following (or similar) lines should be included in your
     ;; .cshrc or .profile to find the manuals (the Ciao installation leaves
     ;; in the Ciao library directory 'DOTcshrc' and 'DOTprofile' files with
     ;; the right paths which can be included directly in your startup scripts):
     ;;
     ;; setenv INFOPATH /usr/local/info:/usr/info:<v>LPDOCDIR</v>
     ;; ------------------------------------------------------------------------

   If you would like to configure things in a different way, you can
also copy the contents of this file to your `.emacs' file and make
the appropriate changes. For example, if you do not want `.pl' files
to be put automatically in Ciao mode, then comment out (or remove)
the line:

   `(setq auto-mode-alist' ... `)'

You will then need to switch manually to Ciao mode by typing `M-x
ciao-mode' after opening a Ciao file.

   If you are able to open the Ciao menu but the Ciao manuals are not
found or the `ciao' command (the top-level) is not found when loading
`.pl' files, the probable cause is that you do not have the Ciao
paths in the `INFOPATH' and `MANPATH' _environment variables_
(whether these variables are set automatically or not for users
depends on how the Ciao system was installed). Under Un*x, you can
add these paths easily by including the line:

   `source <CIAOLIBDIR>/DOTcshrc'

in your `.login' or `.cshrc' files if you are using `csh' (or `tcsh',
etc.), or, alternatively, the line:

   `. <CIAOLIBDIR>/DOTprofile'

in your `.login' or `.profile' files if you are using `sh' (or `bash',
etc.). See the Ciao installation instructions (*note Installing Ciao
from the source distribution:: or *note Installing Ciao from a Win32
binary distribution::) for details.

PART II - The Ciao basic language (engine)
******************************************

*Author(s):* The CLIP Group.

   This part documents the _Ciao basic builtins_. These predefined
predicates and declarations are available in every program, unless the `pure'
package is used (by using a `:- module(_,_,[pure]).' declaration or
`:- use_package(pure).'). These predicates are contained in the
`engine' directory within the `lib' library.  The rest of the library
predicates, including the packages that provide most of the ISO-Prolog
builtins, are documented in subsequent parts.

11 The module system
********************

*Author(s):* Daniel Cabeza, The CLIP Group.

   Modularity is a basic notion in a modern computer language.
Modules allow dividing programs in several parts, which have its own
independent name spaces. The module system in Ciao [CH00a], as in
many other Prolog implementations, is procedure based. This means
that predicate names are local to a module, but functor/atom names in
data are shared (at least by default).

   The predicates visible in a module are the predicates defined in
that module, plus the predicates imported from other modules. Only
predicates exported by a module can be imported from other modules.
The default module of a given predicate name is the local one if the
predicate is defined locally, else the last module from which the
predicate is imported, where explicit imports have priority over
implicit ones (that is, a predicate imported through a `use_module/2'
declaration is always preferred over a predicate imported through a
`use_module/1' declaration). To refer to a predicate from a module
which is not the default module for that predicate the name has to be
module qualified. A module qualified predicate name has the form
`Module':`Predicate' as in the call `debugger:debug_module(M)'. Note
that in Ciao this module qualification cannot be used for gaining
access to predicates that have not been imported, nor for defining
clauses of other modules.

   All predicates defined in files with no module declaration belong
to a special module called `user', from which they are all implicitly
exported. This provides backward compatibility for programs written
for implementations with no module system and allows dividing
programs into several files without being aware of the module system
at all. Note that this feature is only supported for the
above-mentioned backward-compatibility reasons, and the use of `user'
files is discouraged. Many attractive compilation features of Ciao
cannot be supported for `user' modules.

   The case of multifile predicates (defined with the declaration `multifile/1')
is also special. Multifile predicates can be defined by clauses
distributed in several modules, and all modules which define a
predicate as multifile can use that predicate. The name space of
multifile predicates is independent, as if they belonged to the
special module `multifile'.

   Every `user' or module file imports implicitly a number of modules
called builtin modules. They are imported before all other
importations of the module, thus allowing the redefinition of any of
their predicates (with the exception of `true/0') by defining local
versions or importing them from other modules. Importing explicitly
from a builtin module, however, disables the implicit importation of
the rest (this feature is used by package `library(pure)' to define
pure Prolog code).

11.2 Documentation on internals (`modules')
===========================================

 -- DECLARATION: module/3:
     *Usage:* :- `module(Name,Exports,Packages)'.
        - _Description:_ Declares a module of name `Name' which
          exports the predicates in `Exports', and uses the packages
          in `Packages'. `Name' must match with the name of the file
          where the module resides, without extension. For each
          source in `Packages', a package file is used. If the source
          is specified with a path alias, this is the file included,
          if it is an atom, the library paths are searched. See `package/1'
          for a brief description of package files.

          This directive must appear the first in the file.

          Also, if the compiler finds an unknown declaration as the
          first term in a file, the name of the declaration is
          regarded as a package library to be included, and the
          arguments of the declaration (if present) are interpreted
          like the arguments of `module/3'.

        - _The following properties hold at call time:_

          `Name' is a module name (an atom).   (modules:modulename/1)

          `Exports' is a list of `predname's.   (basic_props:list/2)

          `Packages' is a list of `sourcename's.
          (basic_props:list/2)


 -- DECLARATION: module/2:
     *Usage:* :- `module(Name,Exports)'.
        - _Description:_ Same as directive `module/3', with an
          implicit package `default'. This default package provides
          all the standard features provided by most Prolog systems
          so that Prolog programs with traditional `module/2'
          declarations can run without any change.

        - _The following properties hold at call time:_

          `Name' is a module name (an atom).   (modules:modulename/1)

          `Exports' is a list of `predname's.   (basic_props:list/2)


 -- DECLARATION: package/1:
     *Usage:* :- `package(Name)'.
        - _Description:_ Declares a package of name `Name'. Like in
          modules, `Name' must match with the name of the file where
          the package resides, without extension. This directive must
          appear the first in the file.

          Package files provide syntactic extensions and their
          related functionalities by defining operators, new
          declarations, code translations, etc., as well as declaring
          imports from other modules and defining additional code.
          Most Ciao syntactic and semantic extensions, such as
          functional syntax, constraint solving, or breadth-first
          search are implemented as packages.

        - _The following properties hold at call time:_

          `Name' is a module name (an atom).   (modules:modulename/1)


 -- DECLARATION: export/1:
     *Usage 1:* :- `export(Pred)'.
        - _Description:_ Adds `Pred' to the set of exported
          predicates.

        - _The following properties hold at call time:_

          `Pred' is a Name/Arity structure denoting a predicate name:
               predname(P/A) :-
                       atm(P),
                       nnegint(A).

          (basic_props:predname/1)

     *Usage 2:* :- `export(Exports)'.
        - _Description:_ Adds `Exports' to the set of exported
          predicates.

        - _The following properties hold at call time:_

          `Exports' is a list of `predname's.   (basic_props:list/2)


 -- DECLARATION: use_module/2:
     *Usage:* :- `use_module(Module,Imports)'.
        - _Description:_ Specifies that this code imports from the
          module defined in `Module' the predicates in `Imports'. The
          imported predicates must be exported by the other module.

        - _The following properties hold at call time:_

          `Module' is a source name.   (streams_basic:sourcename/1)

          `Imports' is a list of `predname's.   (basic_props:list/2)


 -- DECLARATION: use_module/1:
     *Usage:* :- `use_module(Module)'.
        - _Description:_ Specifies that this code imports from the
          module defined in `Module' all the predicates exported by
          it. The previous version with the explicit import list is
          preferred to this as it minimizes the chances to have to
          recompile this code if the other module changes.

        - _The following properties hold at call time:_

          `Module' is a source name.   (streams_basic:sourcename/1)


 -- DECLARATION: import/2:
     *Usage:* :- `import(Module,Imports)'.
        - _Description:_ Declares that this code imports from the
          module with name `Module' the predicates in `Imports'.

          *Important note:* this declaration is intended to be used
          when the current module or the imported module is going to
          be dynamically loaded, and so the compiler does not include
          the code of the imported module in the current executable
          (if only because the compiler cannot know the location of
          the module file at the time of compilation). For the same
          reason the predicates imported are not checked to be
          exported by `Module'. Its use in other cases is strongly
          discouraged, as it disallows many compiler optimizations.

        - _The following properties hold at call time:_

          `Module' is a module name (an atom).
          (modules:modulename/1)

          `Imports' is a list of `predname's.   (basic_props:list/2)


 -- DECLARATION: reexport/2:
     *Usage:* :- `reexport(Module,Preds)'.
        - _Description:_ Specifies that this code reexports from the
          module defined in `Module' the predicates in `Preds'. This
          implies that this module imports from the module defined in
          `Module' the predicates in `Preds', an also that this
          module exports the predicates in `Preds' .

        - _The following properties hold at call time:_

          `Module' is a source name.   (streams_basic:sourcename/1)

          `Preds' is a list of `predname's.   (basic_props:list/2)


 -- DECLARATION: reexport/1:
     *Usage:* :- `reexport(Module)'.
        - _Description:_ Specifies that this code reexports from the
          module defined in `Module' all the predicates exported by
          it. This implies that this module imports from the module
          defined in `Module' all the predicates exported by it, an
          also that this module exports all such predicates .

        - _The following properties hold at call time:_

          `Module' is a source name.   (streams_basic:sourcename/1)


 -- DECLARATION: meta_predicate/1:
     *Usage:* :- `meta_predicate MetaSpecs'.
        - _Description:_ Specifies that the predicates in `MetaSpecs'
          have arguments which has to be module expanded (predicates,
          goals, etc). The directive is only mandatory for exported
          predicates (in modules). This directive is defined as a
          prefix operator in the compiler.

        - _The following properties hold at call time:_

          `MetaSpecs' is a sequence of `metaspec's.
          (basic_props:sequence/2)


 -- REGTYPE: modulename/1:
     A module name is an atom, not containing characters `:' or `$'.
     Also, `user' and `multifile' are reserved, as well as the module
     names of all builtin modules (because in an executable all
     modules must have distinct names).

     *Usage:* `modulename(M)'
        - _Description:_ `M' is a module name (an atom).


 -- REGTYPE: metaspec/1:
     A meta-predicate specification for a predicate is the functor of
     that predicate applied to terms which represent the kind of
     module expansion that should be applied to each argument.
     Possible contents are represented as:

    `?,+,-,_'
          These values denote that this argument is not module
          expanded.

    `goal'
          This argument will be a term denoting a goal (either a
          simple or complex one) which will be called. For
          commpatibility reasons it can be named as `:' as well.

    `clause'
          This argument will be a term denoting a clause.

    `fact'
          This argument should be instantiated to a term denoting a
          fact (head-only clause).

    `spec'
          This argument should be instantiated to a predicate name,
          as Functor/Arity.

    `pred(_N_)'
          This argument should be instantiated to a predicate
          construct to be called by means of a `call/_N_' predicate
          call (see `call/2').

    `list(_Meta_)'
          This argument should be instantiated to a list of terms as
          described by _Meta_ (e.g. `list(goal)').

    `addterm(Meta)'
          This argument should be instantiated to the meta-data
          specified by _Meta_, and an argument added after this one
          will carry the original data without module expansion. Not
          intended to be used by normal users.

    `addmodule(Meta)'
          This argument should be instantiated to the meta-data
          specified by _Meta_, and in an argument added after this
          one will be passed the calling module, for example to allow
          handling more involved meta-data by using conversion
          builtins. `addmodule' is an alias of `addmodule(?)'. Not
          intended to be used by normal users.


     *Usage:* `metaspec(M)'
        - _Description:_ `M' is a meta-predicate specification.

12.2 Documentation on internals (`loading_code')
================================================

 -- DECLARATION: ensure_loaded/1:
     *Usage:* :- `ensure_loaded(File)'.  < * ISO * >
        - _Description:_ Specifies that the code present in `File'
          will be included in the executable being prepared, in the
          `user' module. The file `File' cannot have a module
          declaration. This directive is intended to be used by
          programs not divided in modules. Dividing programs into
          modules is however strongly encouraged, since most of the
          attractive features of Ciao (such as static debugging and
          global optimization) are only partially available for
          `user' modules.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `File' is a source name.   (streams_basic:sourcename/1)


 -- DECLARATION: include/1:
     *Usage:* :- `include(File)'.  < * ISO * >
        - _Description:_ The contents of the file `File' are included
          in the current program text exactly as if they had been
          written in place of this directive.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `File' is a source name.   (streams_basic:sourcename/1)


 -- DECLARATION: use_package/1:
     :- `use_package(Package)'.

     Specifies the use in this file of the packages defined in
     `Package'. See the description of the third argument of `module/3'
     for an explanation of package files.

     This directive must appear the first in the file, or just after a `module/3'
     declaration. A file with no module declaration, in the absence
     of this directive, uses an implicit package `default' (see *note
     Other predicates and features defined by default::).

     *Usage 1:* :- `use_package(Package)'.
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Package' is a source name.   (streams_basic:sourcename/1)

     *Usage 2:* :- `use_package(Package)'.

   * *Library usage:*

     These predicates/constructs are builtin in Ciao, so nothing

14 Basic builtin directives
***************************

*Author(s):* Daniel Cabeza.

   This chapter documents the basic builtin directives in Ciao,
additional to the documented in other chapters. These directives are
natively interpreted by the Ciao compiler ( `ciaoc').

   Unlike in other Prolog systems, directives in Ciao are not goals
to be _executed_ by the compiler or top level. Instead, they are
_read_ and acted upon by these programs. The advantage of this is
that the effect of the directives is consistent for executables, code
loaded in the top level, code analyzed by the preprocessor, etc.

   As a result, by default only the builtin directives or
declarations defined in this manual can be used in user programs.
However, it is possible to define new declarations using the `new_declaration/1'
and `new_declaration/2' directives (or using packages including
them). Also, packages may define new directives via code translations.

 -- DECLARATION: multifile/1:
     *Usage:* :- `multifile Predicates'.  < * ISO * >
        - _Description:_ Specifies that each predicate in
          `Predicates' may have clauses in more than one file. Each
          file that contains clauses for a multifile predicate must
          contain a directive multifile for the predicate. The
          directive should precede all clauses of the affected
          predicates, and also dynamic/data declarations for the
          predicate. This directive is defined as a prefix operator
          in the compiler.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Predicates' is a sequence or list of `predname's.
          (basic_props:sequence_or_list/2)


 -- DECLARATION: discontiguous/1:
     *Usage:* :- `discontiguous Predicates'.  < * ISO * >
        - _Description:_ Specifies that each predicate in
          `Predicates' may be defined in this file by clauses which
          are not in consecutive order. Otherwise, a warning is
          signaled by the compiler when clauses of a predicate are
          not consecutive (this behavior is controllable by the prolog
          flag _discontiguous_warnings_). The directive should
          precede all clauses of the affected predicates. This
          directive is defined as a prefix operator in the compiler.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Predicates' is a sequence or list of `predname's.
          (basic_props:sequence_or_list/2)


 -- DECLARATION: impl_defined/1:
     *Usage:* :- `impl_defined(Predicates)'.
        - _Description:_ Specifies that each predicate in
          `Predicates' is _impl_icitly _defined_ in the current
          prolog source, either because it is a builtin predicate or
          because it is defined in a C file. Otherwise, a warning is
          signaled by the compiler when an exported predicate is not
          defined in the module or imported from other module.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Predicates' is a sequence or list of `predname's.
          (basic_props:sequence_or_list/2)


 -- DECLARATION: redefining/1:
     *Usage:* :- `redefining(Predicate)'.
        - _Description:_ Specifies that this module redefines
          predicate `Predicate', also imported from other module, or
          imports it from more than one module. This prevents the
          compiler giving warnings about redefinitions of that
          predicate. `Predicate' can be partially (or totally)
          uninstantiated, to allow disabling those warnings for
          several (or all) predicates at once.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Predicate' is _compatible_ with `predname'
          (basic_props:compat/2)


 -- DECLARATION: initialization/1:
     *Usage:* :- `initialization(Goal)'.  < * ISO * >
        - _Description:_ `Goal' will be executed at the start of the
          execution of any program containing the current code. The
          initialization of a module/file never runs before the
          initializations of the modules from which the module/file
          imports (excluding circular dependences).

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Goal' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an atom or
          a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)


 -- DECLARATION: on_abort/1:
     *Usage:* :- `on_abort(Goal)'.
        - _Description:_ `Goal' will be executed after an abort of
          the execution of any program containing the current code.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Goal' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an atom or
          a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)

15 Basic data types and properties
**********************************

*Author(s):* Daniel Cabeza, Manuel Hermenegildo.

   This library contains the set of basic properties used by the
builtin predicates, and which constitute the basic data types and
properties of the language. They can be used both as type testing
builtins within programs (by calling them explicitly) and as
properties in assertions.

   This library contains traditional Prolog predicates for testing
types. They depend on the state of instantiation of their arguments,
thus being of extra-logical nature.

18 Comparing terms
******************

*Author(s):* Daniel Cabeza, Manuel Hermenegildo.

   These built-in predicates are extra-logical. They treat
uninstantiated variables as objects with values which may be
compared, and they never instantiate those variables. They should
_not_ be used when what you really want is arithmetic comparison or
unification.

   The predicates make reference to a _standard total ordering_ of
terms, which is as follows:

   * Variables, by age (roughly, oldest first - the order is _not_
     related to the names of variables).

   * Floats, in numeric order (e.g. -1.0 is put before 1.0).

   * Integers, in numeric order (e.g. -1 is put before 1).

   * Atoms, in alphabetical (i.e. character code) order.

   * Compound terms, ordered first by arity, then by the name of the
     principal functor, then by the arguments in left-to-right order.
     Recall that lists are equivalent to compound terms with
     principal functor `'.'/2'.


   For example, here is a list of terms in standard order:

     [ X, -1.0, -9, 1, bar, foo, [1], X = Y, foo(0,2), bar(1,1,1) ]

19 Basic predicates handling names of constants
***********************************************

*Author(s):* The CLIP Group.

   The Ciao system provides builtin predicates which allow dealing
with names of constants (atoms or numbers). Note that sometimes
strings (character code lists) are more suitable to handle sequences
of characters.

19.1 Usage and interface (`atomic_basic')
=========================================

   * *Library usage:*

     These predicates are builtin in Ciao, so nothing special has to
     be done to use them.

   * *Exports:*

        - _Predicates:_

          `name/2', `atom_codes/2', `number_codes/2', `number_codes/3', `atom_number/2', `atom_number/3', `atom_length/2', `atom_concat/3', `sub_atom/4'.

        - _Properties:_

          `number_codes/3'.

        - _Regular Types:_

          `valid_base/1'.

   * *Other modules used:*

        - _System library modules:_

          `assertions/native_props'.

==============================================

 -- PREDICATE: name/2:
     `name(Const,String)'

     `String' is the list of the ASCII codes of the characters
     comprising the name of `Const'. Note that if `Const' is an atom
     whose name can be interpreted as a number (e.g. '96'), the
     predicate is not reversible, as that atom will not be
     constructed when `Const' is uninstantiated. Thus it is
     recommended that new programs use the ISO-compliant predicates `atom_codes/2'
     or `number_codes/2', as these predicates do not have this
     inconsistency.

     *General properties:*
        - _The following properties hold globally:_

          `name(Const,String)' is side-effect `free'.
          (basic_props:sideff/2)

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP.
          (basic_props:native/1)

     *Usage 1:*
        - _Calls should, and exit will be compatible with:_

          `String' is a string (a list of character codes).
          (basic_props:string/1)

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Const' is an atomic term (an atom or a number).
          (basic_props:constant/1)

        - _The following properties hold upon exit:_

          `String' is a string (a list of character codes).
          (basic_props:string/1)

        - _The following properties hold globally:_

          `name(Const,String)' is evaluable at compile-time.
          (basic_props:eval/1)

     *Usage 2:*
        - _Description:_ If `String' can be interpreted as a number,
          `Const' is unified with that number, otherwise with the
          atom whose name is `String'.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Const' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

          `String' is a string (a list of character codes).
          (basic_props:string/1)

        - _The following properties hold upon exit:_

20 Arithmetic
*************

*Author(s):* Daniel Cabeza, Manuel Hermenegildo.

   Arithmetic is performed by built-in predicates which take as
arguments arithmetic expressions (see `arithexpression/1') and
evaluate them. Terms representing arithmetic expressions can be
created dynamically, but at the time of evaluation, each variable in
an arithmetic expression must be bound to a non-variable expression
(the term must be ground). For example, given the code in the first
line a possible shell interaction follows:
     evaluate(Expression, Answer) :- Answer is Expression.

     ?- _X=24*9, evaluate(_X+6, Ans).

     Ans = 222 ?

     yes

 -- REGTYPE: arithexpression/1:
     An arithmetic expression is a term built from numbers and evaluable
     functors that represent arithmetic functions. An arithmetic
     expression evaluates to a number, which may be an integer ( `int/1')
     or a float ( `flt/1'). The evaluable functors allowed in an
     arithmetic expression are listed below, together with an
     indication of the functions they represent. All evaluable
     functors defined in ISO-Prolog are implemented, as well as some
     other useful or traditional. Unless stated otherwise, an
     expression evaluates to a float if any of its arguments is a
     float, otherwise to an integer.

          to integers, result always integer.


     In addition to these functors, a list of just a number evaluates
     to this number. Since a quoted string is just a list of
     integers, this allows a quoted character to be used in place of
     its ASCII code; e.g. `"A"' behaves within arithmetic expressions
     as the integer 65. Note that this is not ISO-compliant, and that
     can be achieved by using the ISO notation `0'A'.

     Arithmetic expressions, as described above, are just data
     structures. If you want one evaluated you must pass it as an
     argument to one of the arithmetic predicates defined in this
     library.

===============================================

 -- PREDICATE: open/3:
     `open(File,Mode,Stream)'

     Open `File' with mode `Mode' and return in `Stream' the stream
     associated with the file. No extension is implicit in `File'.

     *Usage 1:* < * ISO * >
        - _Description:_ Normal use.

        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `Stream' is an open stream.   (streams_basic:stream/1)

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `File' is a source name.   (streams_basic:sourcename/1)

          (streams_basic:io_mode/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Stream' is an open stream.   (streams_basic:stream/1)

        - _The following properties should hold globally:_

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP.
          (basic_props:native/1)

     *Usage 2:*
        - _Description:_ In the special case that `File' is an
          integer, it is assumed to be a file descriptor passed to
          Prolog from a foreign function call. The file descriptor is
          connected to a Prolog stream (invoking the UNIX function
          `fdopen') which is unified with `Stream'.

        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `Stream' is an open stream.   (streams_basic:stream/1)

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `File' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Mode' is an opening mode ('read', 'write' or 'append').
          (streams_basic:io_mode/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Stream' is an open stream.   (streams_basic:stream/1)


 -- PREDICATE: open/4:
     `open(File,Mode,Stream,Options)'

     Same as `open(`File', `Mode', `Stream')' with options `Options'.
     See the definition of `open_option_list/1' for details.

     *Usage:*
        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `Stream' is an open stream.   (streams_basic:stream/1)

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `File' is a source name.   (streams_basic:sourcename/1)

          `Mode' is an opening mode ('read', 'write' or 'append').
          (streams_basic:io_mode/1)

          `Options' is a list of options for `open/4'.
          (streams_basic:open_option_list/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Stream' is an open stream.   (streams_basic:stream/1)

        - _The following properties should hold globally:_

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP.
          (basic_props:native/1)


 -- REGTYPE: open_option_list/1:
     A list of options for `open/4', currently the meaningful options
     are:

    `lock'
          Try to set an advisory lock for the file. If the open mode
          is `read', the lock is a read (shared) lock, else it is a
          write (exclusive) lock. If the lock cannot be acquired, the
          call waits until it is released (but can fail in
          exceptional cases).

    `lock_nb'
          Same as `lock', but the call immediately fails if the lock
          cannot be acquired.

    `lock(Lock_Mode)'
          Same as `lock', but specifying in `Lock_Mode' whether the
          lock is `read' (also `shared') or `write' (also
          `exclusive'). This option has be included for compatibility
          with the SWI-Prolog locking options, because in general the
          type of lock should match the open mode as in the `lock'
          option.

    `lock_nb(Lock_Mode)'
          Same as the previous option but with the `lock_nb' behavior.


     All file locking is implemented via the POSIX function fcntl().
     Please refer to its manual page for details.

     *Usage:* `open_option_list(L)'
        - _Description:_ `L' is a list of options for `open/4'.


 -- PREDICATE: close/1:
     `close(Stream)'

     Close the stream `Stream'.

     *Usage:* < * ISO * >

        - _The following properties hold upon exit:_

          `Stream' is an open stream.   (streams_basic:stream/1)

        - _The following properties hold globally:_

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP.
          (basic_props:native/1)


 -- PREDICATE: set_input/1:
     `set_input(Stream)'

     Set the current input stream to `Stream'. A notion of _current
     input stream_ is maintained by the system, so that input
     predicates with no explicit stream operate on the current input
     stream. Initially it is set to `user_input'.

     *Usage:* < * ISO * >
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          (basic_props:native/1)


 -- PREDICATE: current_input/1:
     `current_input(Stream)'

     Unify `Stream' with the current input stream. In addition to the
     ISO behavior, stream aliases are allowed. This is useful for
     most applications checking whether a stream is the standard
     input or output.

          (basic_props:native/1)


 -- PREDICATE: set_output/1:
     `set_output(Stream)'

     Set the current output stream to `Stream'. A notion of _current
     output stream_ is maintained by the system, so that output
     predicates with no explicit stream operate on the current output
     stream. Initially it is set to `user_output'.

     *Usage:* < * ISO * >
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Stream' is an open stream.   (streams_basic:stream/1)

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP.
          (basic_props:native/1)

 -- PREDICATE: stream_code/2:
     `stream_code(Stream,StreamCode)'

     `StreamCode' is the file descriptor (an integer) corresponding
     to the Prolog stream `Stream'.

     *Usage 1:*
        - _Calls should, and exit will be compatible with:_

          `StreamCode' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

 -- PREDICATE: absolute_file_name/2:
     `absolute_file_name(RelFileSpec,AbsFileSpec)'

     If `RelFileSpec' is an absolute pathname then do an absolute
     lookup. If `RelFileSpec' is a relative pathname then prefix the
     name with the name of the current directory and do an absolute
     lookup. If `RelFileSpec' is a path alias, perform the lookup
     following the path alias rules (see `sourcename/1'). In all
     cases: if a matching file with suffix `.pl' exists, then
     `AbsFileSpec' will be unified with this file. Failure to open a
     file normally causes an exception. The behaviour can be
     controlled by the `fileerrors' prolog flag.

     *Usage:* `absolute_file_name(RelFileSpec,AbsFileSpec)'
        - _Description:_ `AbsFileSpec' is the absolute name (with
          full path) of `RelFileSpec'.

 -- PREDICATE: absolute_file_name/7:
     `absolute_file_name(Spec,Opt,Suffix,CurrDir,AbsFile,AbsBase,AbsDir)'

     `AbsFile' is the absolute name (with full path) of `Spec', which
     has an optional first suffix `Opt' and an optional second suffix
     `Suffix', when the current directory is `CurrDir'. `AbsBase' is
     the same as `AbsFile', but without the second suffix, and
     `AbsDir' is the absolute path of the directory where `AbsFile'
     is. The Ciao compiler invokes this predicate with `Opt'=`'_opt''
     and `Suffix'=`'.pl'' when searching source files.

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP.
          (basic_props:native/1)


 -- REGTYPE: sourcename/1:
     A source name is a flexible way of referring to a concrete file.
     A source name is either a relative or absolute filename given as:

        * an atom, or

        * a unary functor (which represents a _path alias_, see
          below) applied to a _relative_ path, the latter being given
          as an atom.


     In all cases certain filename extensions (e.g., `.pl') can be
     implicit. In the first form above, file names can be relative to
     the current directory. Also, file names beginning with `~' or
     `$' are treated specially. For example,

    `'~/ciao/sample.pl''
          is equivalent to `'/home/staff/herme/ciao/sample.pl'', if
          `/home/staff/herme' is the user's home directory. (This is
          also equivalent to `'$HOME/ciao/sample.pl'' as explained
          below.)

    `'~bardo/prolog/sample.pl''
          is equivalent to `'/home/bardo/prolog/sample.pl'', if
          `/home/bardo' is bardo's home directory.

    `'$UTIL/sample.pl''
          is equivalent to `'/usr/local/src/utilities/sample.pl'', if
          `/usr/local/src/utilities' is the value of the environment
          variable `UTIL'.


     The second form allows using path aliases. Such aliases allow
     refering to files not with absolute file system paths but with
     paths which are relative to predefined (or user-defined)
     abstract names. For example, given the path alias `myutils'
     which has been defined to refer to path
     `'/home/bardo/utilities'', if that directory contains the file
     `stuff.pl' then the term `myutils(stuff)' in a `use_module/1'
     declaration would refer to the file
     `'/home/bardo/utilities/stuff.pl'' (the `.pl' extension is
     implicit in the `use_module/1' declaration). As a special case,
     if that directory contains a subdirectory named `stuff' which in
     turn contains the file `stuff.pl', the same term would refer to
     the file `'/home/bardo/utilities/stuff/stuff.pl''. If a path
     alias is related to several paths, all paths are scanned in
     sequence until a match is found. For information on predefined
     path aliases or how to define new path aliases, see `file_search_path/2'.

     *Usage:* `sourcename(F)'
        - _Description:_ `F' is a source name.


 -- REGTYPE: stream/1:
     Streams correspond to the file pointers used at the operating
     system level, and usually represent opened files. There are four
     special streams which correspond with the operating system
     standard streams:
    `user_input'
          The standard input stream, i.e. the terminal, usually.

    `user_output'
          The standard output stream, i.e. the terminal, usually.

    `user_error'
          The standard error stream.

    `user'
          The standard input or output stream, depending on context.


     *Usage:* `stream(S)'
        - _Description:_ `S' is an open stream.


 -- REGTYPE: stream_alias/1:
     *Usage:* `stream_alias(S)'
        - _Description:_ `S' is the alias of an open stream, i.e., an
          atom which represents a stream at Prolog level.


 -- REGTYPE: io_mode/1:
     Can have the following values:
    `read'
          Open the file for input.

    `write'
          Open the file for output. The file is created if it does
          not already exist, the file will otherwise be truncated.

    `append'
          Open the file for output. The file is created if it does
          not already exist, the file will otherwise be appended to.


     *Usage:* `io_mode(M)'
        - _Description:_ `M' is an opening mode ('read', 'write' or
          'append').


 -- REGTYPE: atm_or_int/1:
     A regular type, defined as follows:
          atm_or_int(X) :-
                  atm(X).
          atm_or_int(X) :-
                  int(X).

 -- PREDICATE: file_search_path/2:
     `file_search_path(Alias,Path)'

     The path alias `Alias' is linked to path `Path'. Both arguments
     must be atoms. New facts (or clauses) of this predicate can be
     asserted to define new path aliases. Predefined path aliases in
     Ciao are:

    `library'
          Initially points to all Ciao library paths. See `library_directory/1'.

    `engine'
          The path of the Ciao engine builtins.

    `.'
          The current path (`'.'').


     The predicate is _multifile_.

     The predicate is of type _dynamic_.

     `file_search_path(X,Y)'
        - _The following properties hold upon exit:_

          `X' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)

          `Y' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)


 -- PREDICATE: library_directory/1:
     `library_directory(Path)'

     `Path' is a library path (a path represented by the path alias
     `library'). Predefined library paths in Ciao are
     `'$CIAOLIB/lib'', `'$CIAOLIB/library'', and
     `'$CIAOLIB/contrib'', given that `$CIAOLIB' is the path of the
     root ciao library directory. More library paths can be defined
     by asserting new facts (or clauses) of this predicate.

     The predicate is _multifile_.

     The predicate is of type _dynamic_.

     `library_directory(X)'
        - _The following properties hold upon exit:_

          `X' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)

*********************

*Author(s):* Daniel Cabeza, Mats Carlsson.

   This module provides predicates for character input/output and for
canonical term output. From the ISO-Prolog predicates for character
input/output, only the `_code' versions are provided, the rest are
given by `library(iso_byte_char)', using these. Most predicates are
provided in two versions: one that specifies the input or output
stream as the first argument and a second which omits this argument
and uses the current input or output stream.

          `Num' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

        - _The following properties hold globally:_

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP.
          (basic_props:native/1)

          All calls of the form `tab(Num)' are deterministic.
          (native_props:is_det/1)


 -- PREDICATE: code_class/2:
     `code_class(Code,Class)'

     Unifies `Class' with an integer corresponding to the lexical
     class of the character whose code is `Code', with the following
     correspondence:
              0 - layout (includes space, newline, tab)
              1 - small letter
              2 - capital letter (including '_')
              3 - digit
              4 - graphic (includes #$&*+-./:<=>?@^\`~ )
              5 - punctuation (includes !;"'%(),[]{|} )
     Note that in ISO-Prolog the back quote ``' is a punctuation
     character, whereas in Ciao it is a graphic character. Thus, if
     compatibility with ISO-Prolog is desired, the programmer should
     not use this character in unquoted names.

     *Usage:*
        - _Calls should, and exit will be compatible with:_

          `Class' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Code' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

        - _The following properties hold upon exit:_

          `Class' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)


 -- PREDICATE: getct/2:
     `getct(Code,Type)'

     Reads from the current input stream the next character, unifying
     `Code' with its character code, and `Type' with its lexical
     class. At end of stream, unifies both `Code' and `Type' with the
     integer -1. Equivalent to
             get(Code), (Code = -1 -> Type = -1 ; code_class(Code,Type))

     *Usage:*
        - _Calls should, and exit will be compatible with:_

          `Code' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Type' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

        - _The following properties hold upon exit:_

          `Code' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Type' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)


 -- PREDICATE: getct1/2:
     `getct1(Code,Type)'

     Reads from the current input stream the next non-layout
     character, unifying `Code' with its character code, and `Type'
     with its lexical class (which will be nonzero). At end of
     stream, unifies both `Code' and `Type' with the integer -1.
     Equivalent to
             get1(Code), (Code = -1 -> Type = -1 ; code_class(Code,Type))

     *Usage:*
        - _Calls should, and exit will be compatible with:_

          `Code' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Type' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

        - _The following properties hold upon exit:_

          `Code' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Type' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)


 -- PREDICATE: display/2:
     `display(Stream,Term)'

     Displays `Term' onto `Stream'. Lists are output using list
     notation, the other compound terms are output in functional
     notation. Similar to `write_term(Stream, Term,
     [ignore_ops(ops)])', except that curly bracketed notation is not
     used with `{}/1', and the `write_strings' flag is not honored.

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Stream' is an open stream.   (streams_basic:stream/1)

          `Term' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)

        - _The following properties hold upon exit:_

          `Term' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)

        - _The following properties hold globally:_

          `Term' is not further instantiated.
          (basic_props:not_further_inst/2)

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP.
          (basic_props:native/1)


 -- PREDICATE: display/1:
     `display(Term)'

     Behaves like `current_output(S), display(S,Term)'.

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Term' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)

        - _The following properties hold upon exit:_

          (basic_props:not_further_inst/2)

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP.
          (basic_props:native/1)


 -- PREDICATE: displayq/2:
     `displayq(Stream,Term)'

     Similar to `display(Stream, Term)', but atoms and functors that
     can't be read back by `read_term/3' are quoted. Thus, similar to
     `write_term(Stream, Term, [quoted(true), ignore_ops(ops)])',
     with the same exceptions as `display/2'.

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Stream' is an open stream.   (streams_basic:stream/1)

          `Term' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)

     `displayq(Term)'

     Behaves like `current_output(S), displayq(S,Term)'.

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Term' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)

        - _The following properties hold upon exit:_

          `Term' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)

        - _The following properties hold globally:_

          `Term' is not further instantiated.
          (basic_props:not_further_inst/2)

23.2 Documentation on exports (`exceptions')
============================================

 -- PREDICATE: catch/3:
     `catch(Goal,Error,Handler)'

     Executes `Goal'. If an exception is raised during its execution,
     `Error' is unified with the exception, and if the unification
     succeeds, the entire execution derived from `Goal' is aborted,
     and `Handler' is executed. The execution resumes with the
     continuation of the `catch/3' call. For example, given the code
          p(X) :- throw(error), display('---').
          p(X) :- display(X).
     the execution of "`catch(p(0), E, display(E)), display(.),
     fail.'" results in the output "`error.'".

     _Meta-predicate_ with arguments: `catch(goal,?,goal)'.

     *Usage:* < * ISO * >
        - _Calls should, and exit will be compatible with:_

          `Error' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)

          `Handler' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an atom
          or a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Goal' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an atom or
          a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)

        - _The following properties hold upon exit:_

          `Error' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)

          `Handler' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an atom
          or a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)

        - _The following properties hold globally:_

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP.
          (basic_props:native/1)


 -- PREDICATE: intercept/3:
     `intercept(Goal,Signal,Handler)'

     Executes `Goal'. If a signal is send during its execution,
     `Signal' is unified with the exception, and if the unification
     succeeds, `Handler' is executed and then the execution resumes
     after the point where the exception was thrown. To avoid
     infinite loops if `Handler' raises an exception which unifies
     with `Error', the exception handler is deactivated before to
     execute `Handler'. Note the difference with builtin `catch/3',
     given the code
          p(X) :- send_signal(signal), display('---').
          p(X) :- display(X).
     the execution of "`intercept(p(0), E, display(E)), display(.),
     fail.'" results in the output "`error---.0.'".

     _Meta-predicate_ with arguments: `intercept(goal,?,goal)'.

     *Usage:*
        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `Signal' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Goal' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an atom or
          a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)

          `Handler' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an atom
          or a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Signal' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)


 -- PREDICATE: throw/1:
     `throw(Ball)'

     Raises an error, throwing the exception `Ball', to be caught by
     an ancestor `catch/3'. The closest matching ancestor is chosen.
     Exceptions are also thrown by other builtins in case of error.

     *Usage:* `throw(Term)' < * ISO * >
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Term' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)


 -- PREDICATE: send_signal/1:
     `send_signal(Signal)'

     Emits a signal, to be intercept by an ancestor `intercept/3'.
     The closest matching ancestor is chosen. If the signal is not
     intercepted, throws the error `error(unintercepted_signal(Signal),
     send_signal/1-1)'.

     *Usage:* `send_signal(Term)'
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Term' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)


 -- PREDICATE: send_silent_signal/1:
     `send_silent_signal(Signal)'

     Emits a signal as `send_signal/1', but do not throws an error if
     the signal is not intercepted (i.e. just suceeds silently)

     *Usage:* `send_silent_signal(Term)'
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Term' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)


 -- PREDICATE: halt/0:
     `halt'

     Halt the system, exiting to the invoking shell.

     *Usage:* < * ISO * >
        - _The following properties should hold globally:_

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP.
          (basic_props:native/1)


 -- PREDICATE: halt/1:
     `halt(Code)'

     Halt the system, exiting to the invoking shell, returning exit
     code `Code'.

     *Usage:* < * ISO * >
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Code' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Code' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)


 -- PREDICATE: abort/0:
     `abort'

     Abort the current execution.

24 Changing system behaviour and various flags
**********************************************

*Author(s):* Daniel Cabeza, Mats Carlsson.

   Flags define some parameters of the system and control the
behavior of system or library predicates. Each flag has a name and an
associated predefined value, and except some system flags which are
fixed in general their associated value is changeable. Predefined
flags in the system are:

`version'
     The Ciao version, as a term `ciao'(`Version',`Patch'). `Version'
     is a floating point number, `Patch' is an integer. Unchangeable.

`dialect'
     Value set to `ciao'. Used for compatibility with other systems
     when in Prolog mode. Unchangeable.

`argv'
     Its value is a list of atoms representing the program arguments
     supplied when the current executable was invoked. This is the
     value to which is instantiated the argument of the `main/1'
     predicate at executable startup. Unchangeable.

`bounded'
     It is `false', to denote that the range of integers can be
     considered infinite (but see `int/1'). Unchangeable. < * ISO * >

`fileerrors'
     If `on', predicates handling files give errors (throw
     exceptions) when a file is inexistent or an operation is not
     allowed. If `off', fail in that conditions. Initially `on'.

`gc'
     Controls whether garbage collection is done. May be `on'
     (default) or `off'.

`gc_margin'
     An integer `Margin'. If less than `Margin' kilobytes are
     reclaimed in a garbage collection then the size of the garbage
     collected area should be increased. Also, no garbage collection
     is attempted unless the garbage collected area has at least
     `Margin' kilobytes. Initially 500.

`gc_trace'
     Governs garbage collection trace messages. An element off
     `[on,off,terse,verbose]'. Initially `off'.

`integer_rounding_function'
     It is `toward_zero', so that `-1 =:= -3//2' succeeds.
     Unchangeable. < * ISO * >

`max_arity'
     It is 255, so that no compound term (or predicate) can have more
     than this number of arguments. Unchangeable. < * ISO * >

`quiet'
     Controls which messages issued using `io_aux' are actually
     written. As the system uses that library to report its messages,
     this flag controls the _verbosity_ of the system. Possible
     states of the flag are:

    `on'
          No messages are reported.

    `error'
          Only error messages are reported.

    `warning'
          Only error and warning messages are reported.

    `off'
          All messages are reported, except debug messages. This is
          the default state.

    `debug'
          All messages, including debug messages, are reported. This
          is only intended for the system implementators.


`unknown'
     Controls action on calls to undefined predicates. The possible
     states of the flag are:

    `error'
          An error is thrown with the error term
          `existence_error(procedure, F/A)'.

    `fail'
          The call simply fails.

    `warning'
          A warning is written and the call fails.


     The state is initially `error'. < * ISO * >

25 Fast/concurrent update of facts
**********************************

*Author(s):* Daniel Cabeza, Manuel Carro.

   Prolog implementations traditionally implement the concept of dynamic
predicates: predicates which can be inspected or modified at
run-time, adding or deleting individual clauses. The power of this
feature comes at a cost: as new clause bodies can be arbitrarily
added to the program, new predicate calls can arise which are not
'visible' at compile-time, thus complicating global analysis and
optimization of the code. But it is the case that most of the time
what the programmer wants is simply to store data, with the purpose
of sharing it between search branches, predicates, or even execution
threads. In Ciao the concept of data predicate serves this purpose: a
data predicate is a predicate composed exclusively by facts, which
can be inspected, and dynamically added or deleted, at run-time.
Using data predicates instead of normal dynamic predicates brings
benefits in terms of speed, but above all makes the code much easier
to analyze automatically and thus allows better optimization.  

   Also, a special kind of data predicates exists, _concurrent
predicates_, which can be used to communicate/synchronize among
different execution threads (see *note Low-level
concurrency/multithreading primitives::).

   Data predicates must be declared through a `data/1' declaration.
Concurrent data predicates must be declared through a `concurrent/1'
declaration.

25.2 Documentation on exports (`data_facts')
============================================

 -- PREDICATE: asserta_fact/1:
     `asserta_fact(Fact)'

     `Fact' is added to the corresponding data predicate. The fact
     becomes the first clause of the predicate concerned.

     _Meta-predicate_ with arguments: `asserta_fact(fact)'.

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Fact' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an atom or
          a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)


 -- PREDICATE: asserta_fact/2:
     `asserta_fact(Fact,Ref)'

     Same as `asserta_fact/1', instantiating `Ref' to a unique
     identifier of the asserted fact.

     _Meta-predicate_ with arguments: `asserta_fact(fact,?)'.

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Fact' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an atom or
          a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)

          `Ref' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Ref' is a reference of a dynamic or data clause.
          (data_facts:reference/1)


 -- PREDICATE: assertz_fact/1:
     `assertz_fact(Fact)'

     `Fact' is added to the corresponding data predicate. The fact
     becomes the last clause of the predicate concerned.

     _Meta-predicate_ with arguments: `assertz_fact(fact)'.

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Fact' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an atom or
          a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          (data_facts:reference/1)


 -- PREDICATE: current_fact/1:
     `current_fact(Fact)'

     Gives on backtracking all the facts defined as data or
     concurrent which unify with `Fact'. It is faster than calling
     the predicate explicitly, which do invoke the meta-interpreter.
     If the `Fact' has been defined as concurrent and has not been closed, `current_fact/1'
     will wait (instead of failing) for more clauses to appear after
     the last clause of `Fact' is returned.

     _Meta-predicate_ with arguments: `current_fact(fact)'.

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Fact' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an atom or
          a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

     `current_fact(Fact,Ref)'

     `Fact' is a fact of a data predicate and `Ref' is its reference
     identifying it uniquely.

     _Meta-predicate_ with arguments: `current_fact(fact,?)'.

     *Usage 1:*
        - _Description:_ Gives on backtracking all the facts defined
          as data which unify with `Fact', instantiating `Ref' to a
          unique identifier for each fact.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Fact' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an atom or
          a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)

          `Ref' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Ref' is a reference of a dynamic or data clause.
          (data_facts:reference/1)

     *Usage 2:*
        - _Description:_ Given `Ref', unifies `Fact' with the fact
          identified by it.

        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `Fact' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an atom or
          a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Ref' is a reference of a dynamic or data clause.
          (data_facts:reference/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Fact' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an atom or
          a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)


 -- PREDICATE: retract_fact/1:
     `retract_fact(Fact)'

     Unifies `Fact' with the first matching fact of a data predicate,
     and then erases it. On backtracking successively unifies with
     and erases new matching facts. If `Fact' is declared as concurrent
     and is non- closed, `retract_fact/1' will wait for more clauses
     or for the closing of the predicate after the last matching
     clause has been removed.

     _Meta-predicate_ with arguments: `retract_fact(fact)'.

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Fact' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an atom or
          a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)


 -- PREDICATE: retractall_fact/1:
     `retractall_fact(Fact)'

     Erase all the facts of a data predicate unifying with `Fact'.
     Even if all facts are removed, the predicate continues to exist.

     _Meta-predicate_ with arguments: `retractall_fact(fact)'.

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Fact' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an atom or
          a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Fact' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an atom or
          a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)


 -- PREDICATE: current_fact_nb/1:
     `current_fact_nb(Fact)'

     Behaves as `current_fact/1' but a fact is never waited on even
     if it is concurrent and non-closed.

     _Meta-predicate_ with arguments: `current_fact_nb(fact)'.

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Fact' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an atom or

          `Fact' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an atom or
          a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)


 -- PREDICATE: close_predicate/1:
     `close_predicate(Pred)'

     Changes the behavior of the predicate `Pred' if it has been
     declared as a concurrent predicate: calls to this predicate will
     fail (instead of wait) if no more clauses of `Pred' are
     available.

     _Meta-predicate_ with arguments: `close_predicate(fact)'.

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

 -- DECLARATION: op/3:
     *Usage:* :- `op(Priority,Op_spec,Operator)'.  < * ISO * >
        - _Description:_ Updates the operator table for reading the
          terms in the rest of the current text, in the same way as
          the builtin `op/3' does. Its scope is local to the current
          text. Usually included in package files.

        - _The following properties hold at call time:_

          `Priority' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Op_spec' specifies the type and associativity of an
          operator.   (basic_props:operator_specifier/1)

          `Operator' is an atom or a list of atoms.
          (basic_props:atm_or_atm_list/1)


 -- DECLARATION: new_declaration/1:
     *Usage:* :- `new_declaration(Predicate)'.
        - _Description:_ Declares `Predicate' to be a valid
          declaration in the rest of the current text. Such
          declarations are simply ignored by the compiler or top
          level, but can be used by other code processing programs
          such as an automatic documentator. Also, they can easily
          translated into standard code (a set of facts and/or rules)
          by defining a suitable expansion (e.g., by `add_sentence_trans/1',
          etc.). This is tipically done in package files.

          Equivalent to `new_declaration(Predicate, off)'.

        - _The following properties hold at call time:_

          `Predicate' is a Name/Arity structure denoting a predicate
          name:
               predname(P/A) :-
                       atm(P),
                       nnegint(A).

          (basic_props:predname/1)


 -- DECLARATION: new_declaration/2:
     *Usage:* :- `new_declaration(Predicate,In_Itf)'.
        - _Description:_ Declares `Predicate' to be a valid
          declaration in the rest of the current text. Such
          declarations will be included in the interface file for
          this file if `In_Itf' is 'on', not if it is 'off'.
          Including such declarations in interface files makes them
          visible while processing other modules which make use of
          this one.

        - _The following properties hold at call time:_

          `Predicate' is a Name/Arity structure denoting a predicate
          name:
               predname(P/A) :-
                       atm(P),
                       nnegint(A).

          (basic_props:predname/1)

          `In_Itf' is 'on' or 'off'  (syntax_extensions:switch/1)


 -- DECLARATION: load_compilation_module/1:
     *Usage:* :- `load_compilation_module(File)'.
        - _Description:_ Loads code defined in `File' into the
          compiler, usually including predicates which define
          translations of clauses, sentences, and terms, for use with
          the declarations `add_sentence_trans/2' and similar ones.
          The application order of translations is determined by
          ascending _priority_ numbers. Normally included in package
          files.

        - _The following properties hold at call time:_

          `File' is a source name.   (streams_basic:sourcename/1)


 -- DECLARATION: add_sentence_trans/2:
     *Usage:* :- `add_sentence_trans(Predicate,Priority)'.
        - _Description:_ Starts a translation, defined by
          `Predicate', of the terms read by the compiler in the rest
          of the current text. For each subsequent term read by the
          compiler, the translation predicate is called to obtain a
          new term which will be used by the compiler as if it where
          the term present in the file. If the call fails, the term
          is used as such. A list may be returned also, to translate
          a single term into several terms. Before calling the
          translation predicate with actual program terms, it is
          called with an input of `0' to give an opportunity of
          making initializations for the module, discarding the
          result (note that normally a 0 could not be there).
          `Predicate' must be exported by a module previously loaded
          with a `load_compilation_module/1' declaration. Normally
          included in package files.

        - _The following properties hold at call time:_

          `Predicate' is a translation predicate spec (has arity 2 or
          3).   (syntax_extensions:translation_predname/1)

          `Priority' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)


 -- DECLARATION: add_term_trans/2:
     *Usage:* :- `add_term_trans(P,Priority)'.
        - _Description:_ Starts a translation, defined by
          `Predicate', of the terms and sub-terms read by the
          compiler in the rest of the current text. This translation
          is performed after all translations defined by `add_sentence_trans/1'
          are done. For each subsequent term read by the compiler,
          and recursively any subterm included, the translation
          predicate is called to possibly obtain a new term to
          replace the old one. Care must be taken of not introducing
          an endless loop of translations. `Predicate' must be
          exported by a module previously loaded with a `load_compilation_module/1'
          declaration. Normally included in package files.

        - _The following properties hold at call time:_

          `P' is a translation predicate spec (has arity 2 or 3).
          (syntax_extensions:translation_predname/1)

          `Priority' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)


 -- DECLARATION: add_goal_trans/2:
     *Usage:* :- `add_goal_trans(Predicate,Priority)'.
        - _Description:_ Declares a translation, defined by
          `Predicate', of the goals present in the clauses of the
          current text. This translation is performed after all
          translations defined by `add_sentence_trans/1' and `add_term_trans/1'
          are done. For each clause read by the compiler, the
          translation predicate is called with each goal present in
          the clause to possibly obtain other goal to substitute the
          original one, and the translation is subsequently applied
          to the resulting goal. Care must be taken of not
          introducing an endless loop of translations. `Predicate'
          must be exported by a module previously loaded with a `load_compilation_module/1'
          declaration. Bear in mind that this type of translation
          noticeably slows down compilation. Normally included in package
          files.

        - _The following properties hold at call time:_

          `Predicate' is a translation predicate spec (has arity 2 or
          3).   (syntax_extensions:translation_predname/1)

          `Priority' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)


 -- DECLARATION: add_clause_trans/2:
     *Usage:* :- `add_clause_trans(Predicate,Priority)'.
        - _Description:_ Declares a translation, defined by
          `Predicate', of the clauses of the current text. The
          translation is performed before `add_goal_trans/1'
          translations but after `add_sentence_trans/1' and `add_term_trans/1'
          translations. The usefulness of this translation is that
          information of the interface of related modules is
          available when it is performed. For each clause read by the
          compiler, the translation predicate is called with the
          first argument instantiated to a structure
          `clause(Head,Body)', and the predicate must return in the
          second argument a similar structure, without changing the
          functor in `Head' (or fail, in which case the clause is
          used as is). Before executing the translation predicate
          with actual clauses it is called with an input of
          `clause(0,0)', discarding the result.

        - _The following properties hold at call time:_

          `Predicate' is a translation predicate spec (has arity 2 or
          3).   (syntax_extensions:translation_predname/1)

          `Priority' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)


 -- REGTYPE: translation_predname/1:
     A translation predicate is a predicate of arity 2 or 3 used to
     make compile-time translations. The compiler invokes a
     translation predicate instantiating its first argument with the
     item to be translated, and if the predicate is of arity 3 its
     third argument with the name of the module where the translation
     is done. If the call is successful, the second argument is used
     as if that item were in the place of the original, else the
     original item is used.

     *Usage:* `translation_predname(P)'
        - _Description:_ `P' is a translation predicate spec (has
          arity 2 or 3).

27.2 Documentation on exports (`io_aux')
========================================

 -- PREDICATE: message/2:
     *Usage:* `message(Type,Message)'
        - _Description:_ Output to standard error `Message', which is
          of type `Type'. The `quiet' _prolog flag_ (see *note
          Changing system behaviour and various flags::) controls
          which messages are actually output, depending on its type.
          Also, for `error', `warning' and `note' messages, a prefix
          is output which denotes the severity of the message.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          Specifies the different types of messages.
          (io_aux:message_type/1)

          `Message' is an item or a list of items from this list:

         `$$(String)'
               `String' is a string, which is output with `display_string/1'.

         `''(Term)'
               `Term' is output quoted. If the module `write' is
               loaded, the term is output with `writeq/1', else with `displayq/1'.

         `~~(Term)'
               `Term' is output unquoted. If the module `write' is
               loaded, the term is output with `write/1', else with `display/1'.

         `[](Term)'
               `Term' is recursively output as a message, can be an
               item or a list of items from this list.

         `Term'
               Any other term is output with `display/1'.


          (io_aux:message_text/1)


 -- PREDICATE: message_lns/4:
     *Usage:* `message_lns(Type,L0,L1,Message)'
        - _Description:_ Output to standard error `Message', which is
          of type `Type', and occurs between lines `L0' and `L1'.
          This is the same as `message/2', but printing the lines
          where the message occurs in a unified way (this is useful
          because automatic tools such as the emacs mode know how to
          parse them).

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          Specifies the different types of messages.
          (io_aux:message_type/1)

          `L0' is a non-negative integer.   (basic_props:nnegint/1)

          `L1' is a non-negative integer.   (basic_props:nnegint/1)

          `Message' is an item or a list of items from this list:

         `$$(String)'
               `String' is a string, which is output with `display_string/1'.

         `''(Term)'
               `Term' is output quoted. If the module `write' is
               loaded, the term is output with `writeq/1', else with `displayq/1'.

         `~~(Term)'
               `Term' is output unquoted. If the module `write' is
               loaded, the term is output with `write/1', else with `display/1'.

         `[](Term)'
               `Term' is recursively output as a message, can be an
               item or a list of items from this list.

         `Term'
               Any other term is output with `display/1'.


          (io_aux:message_text/1)


 -- PREDICATE: messages/1:
     *Usage:* `messages(Messages)'
        - _Description:_ Print each element in `Messages' using `message/2', `message_lns/4', `message/1', `error/1', `warning/1', `note/1'
          or `debug/1' predicate. If the element should be printed
          using message_lns/4, it is printed in a compact way,
          avoiding to print the same file name several times.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Messages' is a list of `message_info's.
          (basic_props:list/2)


 -- PREDICATE: error/1:
     Defined as
          error(Message) :-
                  message(error,Message).

          warning(Message) :-
                  message(warning,Message).
     .


 -- PREDICATE: note/1:
     Defined as
          note(Message) :-
                  message(note,Message).
     .


 -- PREDICATE: message/1:
     Defined as
          message(Message) :-

     Defined as
          debug(Message) :-
                  message(debug,Message).
     .


 -- PREDICATE: inform_user/1:
     `inform_user(Message)'

     Similar to `message/1', but `Message' is output with `display_list/1'.
     This predicate is obsolete, and may disappear in future versions.


 -- PREDICATE: display_string/1:
     `display_string(String)'

     Output `String' as the sequence of characters it represents.

     *Usage:* `display_string(String)'
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `String' is a string (a list of character codes).
          (basic_props:string/1)


 -- PREDICATE: display_list/1:
     `display_list(List)'

     Outputs `List'. If `List' is a list, do `display/1' on each of
     its elements, else do `display/1' on `List'.


 -- PREDICATE: display_term/1:
     `display_term(Term)'

     Output `Term' in a way that a `read/1' will be able to read it
     back, even if operators change.


 -- REGTYPE: message_info/1:
     *Usage:*
        - _Description:_ The type of the elements to be printed using
          the `messages/1' predicate. Defined as
               message_info(message_lns(Source,Ln0,Ln1,Type,Text)) :-
                       atm(Source),
                       nnegint(Ln0),
                       nnegint(Ln1),
                       message_type(Type),
                       message_text(Text).
               message_info(message(Type,Text)) :-
                       atm(Type),
                       message_text(Text).
               message_info(error(Text)) :-

               message_info(message(Text)) :-
                       message_text(Text).
               message_info(debug(Text)) :-
                       message_text(Text).
          .


 -- REGTYPE: message_type/1:
     *Usage:*
        - _Description:_ Specifies the different types of messages.


 -- PREDICATE: add_lines/4:
     No further documentation available for this predicate.

27.3 Known bugs and planned improvements (`io_aux')
===================================================

   * Run-time checks have been reported not to work with this code.
     That means that either the assertions here, or the code that
     implements the run-time checks are erroneous.

   * `message/2' assumes that a module with name 'write' is
     library(write).

*Author(s):* Christian Holzbaur, Daniel Cabeza, Manuel Carro.

   These predicates allow the manipulation of _attributed variables_.
Attributes are special terms which are attached to a (free) variable,
and are hidden from the normal Prolog computation. They can only be
treated by using the predicates below.

28.4 Other information (`attributes')
=====================================

Note that `combine_attributes/2' and `verify_attribute/2' are not
called with the attributed variables involved, but with the
corresponding attributes instead. The reasons are:

   * There are simple applications which only refer to the attributes.

   * If the application wants to refer to the attributed variables
     themselves, they can be made part the attribute term. The
     implementation of `freeze/2' utilizes this technique. Note that
     this does not lead to cyclic structures, as the connection
     between an attributed variable and its attribute is invisible to
     the pure parts of the Prolog implementation.

   * If attributed variables were passed as arguments, the user code
     would have to refer to the attributes through an extra call to `get_attribute/2'.

   * As the/one attribute is the first argument to each of the two
     predicates, indexing applies. Note that attributed variables
     themselves look like variables to the indexing mechanism.


   However, future improvements may change or extend the interface to
attributed variables in order to provide a richer and more expressive
interface.

   For customized output of attributed variables, please refer to the
documentation of the predicate `portray_attribute/2'.

29 Internal Runtime Information
*******************************

*Author(s):* Daniel Cabeza, Manuel Carro, Jose F. Morales.

   This module provides internal information about the current
running engine and enviroment. That information includes the
architecture, platform, operating system, location of libraries, and
C header files. That information is mainly used in parts of the Ciao
dynamic compilation (location of source, generation of gluecode for
the foreign interface, etc.).

 -- PREDICATE: get_arch/1:
     This predicate will describe the computer architecture wich is
     currently executing the predicate.

     Computer architectures are identified by a simple atom. This
     atom is implementation-defined, and may suffer any change from
     one Ciao version to another.

     For example, Ciao running on an Intel-based machine will
     retrieve:
          ?- get_arch(I).

          I = i86 ? ;

          no
          ?-

     *Usage:* `get_arch(ArchDescriptor)'

30 Conditional Compilation
**************************

*Author(s):* Jose F. Morales.

   This package defines a serie of directives for conditional
compilation that allow the inclusion or exclusion of code blocks
(which may contain nested conditional directives) based on the truth
value at compile time of special goals called _conditions_. The
syntax for conditional directives is:

     :- if(Cond1).
       <<Block1>>
     :- elif(Cond2).
       <<Block2>>
     :- else.
       <<BlockN>>
     :- endif.

where `elif(_)' can appear zero or more times and the `else' part is
optional. The valid conditions are:

   * calls to `current_prolog_flag/2'.

   * conjunctions, disjunctions, or negations of conditions.

   The sentences in `Block1' are included if the condition in `Cond1'
is satisfied, else `Block2' is included if `Cond2' is satisfied (and
so on for each `elif'), and `BlockN' if no previous condition is
satisfied.

30.1 Usage and interface (`condcomp_doc')
=========================================

   * *Library usage:*

     The conditional compilation directives are enabled by including
     the `condcomp' package in the package list of a module or by
     means of an explicit `:- use_package(condcomp)'

=========================================================

   * This package implements a `:- define(X)' directive and

31 Other predicates and features defined by default
***************************************************

*Author(s):* Daniel Cabeza.

   To simplify the use of Ciao Prolog to the first-timers, some other
predicates and features are defined by default in normal cases, to
provide more or less what other prologs define by default. Here are
explicitly listed the predicates defined, coming from several
libraries. Apart from those, the features defined in *note Definite
clause grammars:: and *note Enabling operators at run-time:: are also
activated.

31.1 Usage and interface (`default_predicates')
===============================================

   * *Library usage:*

     No need of explicit loading. It is included by default in
     modules starting with a `module/2' declaration or user files
     without a starting `use_package/1' declaration. In the Ciao
     shell, it is loaded by default when no `~/.ciaorc' exists. Note
     that `:- module(_modulename_,_exports_)' is equivalent to `:-
     module(_modulename_,_exports_,[default])' If you do not want
     these predicates/features loaded for a given file (in order to
     make the executable smaller) you can ask for this explicitly
     using `:- module(_modulename_,_exports_,[])' or in a user file
     `:- use_package([])'.

   * *Other modules used:*

        - _System library modules:_

          `aggregates', `dynamic', `read', `write', `operators', `iso_byte_char', `iso_misc', `format', `lists', `sort', `between', `compiler/compiler', `system', `prolog_sys', `dec10_io', `old_database', `ttyout'.

***************************

*Author(s):* Richard A. O'Keefe (first version), David H.D. Warren
(first version), Mats Carlsson (changes), Daniel Cabeza, Manuel
Hermenegildo.

   This module implements the standard solution aggregation
predicates.

   When there are many solutions to a problem, and when all those
solutions are required to be collected together, this can be achieved
by repeatedly backtracking and gradually building up a list of the
solutions. The following built-in predicates are provided to automate
this process.

============================================

 -- PREDICATE: setof/3:
     `setof(Template,Generator,Set)'

     Finds the `Set' of instances of the `Template' satisfying
     `Generator'. The set is in ascending order (see *note Comparing
     terms:: for a definition of this order) without duplicates, and
     is non-empty. If there are no solutions, `setof' fails. `setof'
     may succeed in more than one way, binding free variables in
     `Generator' to different values. This can be avoided by using
     existential quantifiers on the free variables in front of
     `Generator', using `^/2'. For example, given the clauses:
          father(bill, tom).
          father(bill, ann).
          father(bill, john).
          father(harry, july).
          father(harry, daniel).

     The following query produces two alternative solutions via
     backtracking:
          ?- setof(X,father(F,X),Sons).

          F = bill,
          Sons = [ann,john,tom] ? ;

          F = harry,
          Sons = [daniel,july] ? ;

          no
          ?-

     _Meta-predicate_ with arguments: `setof(?,goal,?)'.

     *General properties:* `setof(X,Y,Z)'
        - _The following properties hold globally:_

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP as
          `findall(X,Y,Z)'.   (basic_props:native/2)

     *Usage:* < * ISO * >
        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `Set' is a list.   (basic_props:list/1)

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Template' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)

          `Generator' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an
          atom or a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Template' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)

        - _The following properties should hold globally:_

          `Template' is not further instantiated.
          (basic_props:not_further_inst/2)


 -- PREDICATE: bagof/3:
     `bagof(Template,Generator,Bag)'

     Finds all the instances of the `Template' produced by the
     `Generator', and returns them in the `Bag' in the order in which
     they were found. If the `Generator' contains free variables
     which are not bound in the `Template', it assumes that this is
     like any other Prolog question and that you want bindings for
     those variables. This can be avoided by using existential
     quantifiers on the free variables in front of the `Generator',
     using `^/2'.

     _Meta-predicate_ with arguments: `bagof(?,goal,?)'.

     *General properties:* `bagof(X,Y,Z)'
        - _The following properties hold globally:_

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP as
          `findall(X,Y,Z)'.   (basic_props:native/2)

     *Usage:* < * ISO * >
        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `Bag' is a list.   (basic_props:list/1)

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Template' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)

          `Generator' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an
          atom or a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Template' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)

          `Bag' is a list.   (basic_props:list/1)

        - _The following properties should hold globally:_

          `Template' is not further instantiated.
          (basic_props:not_further_inst/2)


 -- PREDICATE: findall/3:
     `findall(Template,Generator,List)'

     A special case of bagof, where all free variables in the
     `Generator' are taken to be existentially quantified. Faster
     than the other aggregation predicates.

     _Meta-predicate_ with arguments: `findall(?,goal,?)'.

     *Usage:* < * ISO * >
        - _Calls should, and exit will be compatible with:_

          `List' is a list.   (basic_props:list/1)

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Template' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)

          `Generator' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an
          atom or a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)

        - _The following properties hold upon exit:_

          `Template' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)

          `List' is a list.   (basic_props:list/1)

        - _The following properties hold globally:_

          `Template' is not further instantiated.
          (basic_props:not_further_inst/2)

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP.
          (basic_props:native/1)

          All the calls of the form
          `findall(Template,Generator,List)' do not fail.
          (native_props:not_fails/1)

          All calls of the form `findall(Template,Generator,List)'
          are deterministic.   (native_props:is_det/1)


 -- PREDICATE: findall/4:
     _Meta-predicate_ with arguments: `findall(?,goal,?,?)'.

     *Usage:*
        - _Description:_ As `findall/3', but returning in `Tail' the
          tail of `List' (findall(`Template', `Generator', `List',
          `Tail')).

        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `Arg3' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)

 -- PREDICATE: findnsols/4:
     `findnsols(N,Template,Generator,List)'

     As `findall/3', but generating at most `N' solutions of
     `Generator'. Thus, the length of `List' will not be greater than
     `N'. If `N'=<0, returns directly an empty list. This predicate
     is especially useful if `Generator' may have an infinite number
     of solutions.

34 Dynamic predicates
*********************

*Author(s):* Daniel Cabeza, The CLIP Group.

   The package `dynamic_clauses' provides the assert/retract family
of predicates to manipulate dynamic predicates.

   The defined predicates allow modification of the program as it is
actually running. Clauses can be added to the program (_asserted_) or
removed from the program (_retracted_), as well as inspected. Note
that in Ciao only the dynamic predicates of the current module (or
accessible dynamic multifile predicates) can be accessed and
modified. This limits the bad impact to global analysis of this
dynamic modification of the program. Thus, if dynamic predicates are
exported, to be able to inspect or modify them externally some
accessing predicates need to be implemented and exported alongside.

   For the inspecting/manipulating predicates, the argument which
corresponds to the clause head must be instantiated to an atom or a
compound term. The argument corresponding to the clause must be
instantiated either to a term `Head :- Body' or, if the body part is
empty, to `Head'. An empty body part is represented as `true'.

   Note that using this library is very detrimental to global
analysis, and that for most uses the predicates listed in *note
Fast/concurrent update of facts:: suffice.

34.1 Usage and interface (`dynamic_rt')
=======================================

   * *Library usage:*

     To be able to handle dynamic predicates in a module, load the
     library package `dynamic_clauses', either by putting it in the
     package list of the module or using the `use_package/1'
     directive. Do not load directly the `dynamic_rt' module.

   * *Exports:*

        - _Predicates:_

          `asserta/1', `asserta/2', `assertz/1', `assertz/2', `assert/1', `assert/2', `retract/1', `retractall/1', `abolish/1', `clause/2', `mfclause/2', `current_predicate/1', `current_predicate/2', `dynamic/1', `data/1', `wellformed_body/3'.

        - _Multifiles:_

          `do_on_abolish/1'.

   * *Other modules used:*

        - _System library modules:_

          `prolog_sys', `iso_misc'.

        - _Description:_ The current instance of `Clause' is
          interpreted as a clause and is added to the current

          `Clause' is erased. The predicate concerned must be dynamic.

          The predicate `retract/1' may be used in a non-determinate
          fashion, i.e., it will successively retract clauses
          matching the argument through backtracking. If reactivated
          by backtracking, invocations of the predicate whose clauses
          are being retracted will proceed unaffected by the
          retracts. This is also true for invocations of `clause' for
          the same predicate. The space occupied by a retracted
          clause will be recovered when instances of the clause are
          no longer in use.

          reached, `Term' is unified with the term `end_of_file'.
          Further calls to `read/2' for the same stream will then
          cause an error, unless the stream is connected to the
          terminal (in which case a prompt is opened on the terminal).

   This library provides different predicates for term output,
additional to the kernel predicates `display/1'- `display/2' and
`displayq/1'-`displayq/2'. All the predicates defined in ISO-Prolog
are included, plus other traditionally provided by Prolog
Implementations. Output predicates are provided in two versions: one
that uses the current output stream and other in which the stream is
specified explicitly, as an additional first argument.

        - _Description:_ Behaves like `current_output(S),
          write_term(S,Term,OptList)'.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `OptList' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          (basic_props:list/2)


 -- PROPERTY: write_option/1:
     `Opt' is a valid write option which affects the predicate
     `write_term/3' and similar ones. Possible write_options are:
        * *quoted(*_bool_*):* If _bool_ is `true', atoms and functors
          that can't be read back by `read_term/3' are quoted, if it
          is `false', each atom and functor is written as its name.
          Default value is `false'.

        * *ignore_ops(*_flag_*):* If _flag_ is `true', each compound
          term is output in functional notation, if it is `ops',
          curly bracketed notation and list notation is enabled when
          outputing compound terms, if it is `false', also operator
          notation is enabled when outputing compound terms. Default
          value is `false'.

        * *numbervars(*_bool_*):* If _bool_ is `true', a term of the
          form `'$VAR'(N)' where `N' is an integer, is output as a
          variable name consisting of a capital letter possibly
          followed by an integer, a term of the form `'$VAR'(Atom)'
          where `Atom' is an atom, as this atom (without quotes), and
          a term of the form `'$VAR'(String)' where `String' is a
          character string, as the atom corresponding to this
          character string. See predicates `numbervars/3' and
          `prettyvars/1'. If _bool_ is `false' this cases are not
          treated in any special way. Default value is `false'.

        * *portrayed(*_bool_*):* If _bool_ is `true', then call
          multifile predicates `portray/1' and `portray_attribute/2',
          to provide the user handlers for pretty printing some
          terms. `portray_attribute/2' is called whenever an
          attributed variable is to be printed, `portray/1' is called
          whenever a non-variable term is to be printed. If either
          call succeeds, then it is assumed that the term has been
          output, else it is printed as usual. If _bool_ is `false',
          these predicates are not called. Default value is `false'.
          This option is set by the toplevel when writting the final
          values of variables, and by the debugging package when
          writting the goals in the tracing messages. Thus you can
          vary the forms of these messages if you wish.

        * *max_depth(*_depth_*):* _depth_ is a positive integer or
          cero. If it is positive, it denotes the depth limit on
          printing compound terms. If it is cero, there is no limit.
          Default value is `0' (no limit).

        * *priority(*_prio_*):* _prio_ is an integer between 1 and
          1200. If the term to be printed has higher priority than
          _prio_, it will be printed parenthesized. Default value is
          1200 (no term parenthesized).

37 Defining operators
*********************

*Author(s):* Daniel Cabeza (modifications and documentation, adapted
from SICStus 0.6 code), Manuel Carro (modifications and
documentation).

   Operators allow writting terms in a more clear way than the
standard functional notation. Standard operators in Ciao are defined
by this predicate (but note that the compiler itself defines more
operators at compile time):
     standard_ops :-
             op(1200,xfx,[:-]),
             op(1200,fx,[:-,?-]),
             op(1100,xfy,[;]),
             op(1050,xfy,[->]),
             op(1000,xfy,[',']),
             op(900,fy,[\+]),
             op(700,xfx,[=,\=,==,\==,@<,@>,@=<,@>=,=..,is,=:=,=\=,<,=<,>,>=]),
             op(550,xfx,[:]),
             op(500,yfx,[+,-,/\,\/,#]),
             op(500,fy,[++,--]),

===========================================

 -- PREDICATE: op/3:
     `op(Precedence,Type,Name)'

     Declares the atom `Name' to be an operator of the stated `Type'
     and `Precedence' (0 =< `Precedence' =< 1200). `Name' may also be
     a list of atoms in which case all of them are declared to be
     operators. If `Precedence' is 0 then the operator properties of
     `Name' (if any) are cancelled. Note that, unlike in ISO-Prolog,
     it is allowed to define two operators with the same name, one
     infix and the other postfix.

     *Usage:* < * ISO * >
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Precedence' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Type' specifies the type and associativity of an operator.
          (basic_props:operator_specifier/1)

          `Name' is an atom or a list of atoms.
          (basic_props:atm_or_atm_list/1)

        - _The following properties should hold globally:_

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP.
          (basic_props:native/1)


 -- PREDICATE: current_op/3:
     `current_op(Precedence,Type,Op)'

     The atom `Op' is currently an operator of type `Type' and
     precedence `Precedence'. Neither `Op' nor the other arguments
     need be instantiated at the time of the call; i.e., this
     predicate can be used to generate as well as to test.

     *Usage:* < * ISO * >
        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `Precedence' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Type' specifies the type and associativity of an operator.
          (basic_props:operator_specifier/1)

          `Op' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Precedence' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Type' specifies the type and associativity of an operator.
          (basic_props:operator_specifier/1)

          `Op' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

        - _The following properties should hold globally:_

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP.
          (basic_props:native/1)


 -- PREDICATE: current_prefixop/3:
     `current_prefixop(Op,Less,Precedence)'

     Similar to `current_op/3', but it concerns only the prefix
     operators. It returns *only one solution*. Not a predicate for
     general use.

     *Usage:*
        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `Op' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

          `Less' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Precedence' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Op' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

          `Less' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          (basic_props:native/1)


 -- PREDICATE: current_infixop/4:
     `current_infixop(Op,LeftLess,Prec,RightLess)'

     Similar to `current_op/3', but it concerns only infix operators.
     It returns *only one solution*. Not a predicate for general use.

     *Usage:*
        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `Op' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

          `LeftLess' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Prec' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `RightLess' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP.
          (basic_props:native/1)


 -- PREDICATE: current_postfixop/3:
     `current_postfixop(Op,Less,Precedence)'

     Similar to `current_op/3', but it concerns only the postfix
     operators. It returns *only one solution*. Not a predicate for
     general use.

     *Usage:*
        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `Op' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

          `Less' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Precedence' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Op' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

          `Less' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Precedence' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

        - _The following properties should hold globally:_

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP.
          (basic_props:native/1)

 -- PREDICATE: once/1:
     `once(G)'

     Finds the first solution of goal `G' (if any).  `once/1' behaves

PART IV - Classic Prolog library (classic)
******************************************

*Author(s):* The CLIP Group.

   This part documents some Ciao libraries which provide additional
predicates and functionalities that, despite not being in the ISO
standard, are present in many popular Prolog systems. This includes
definite clause grammars (DCGs), "Quintus-style" internal database,
list processing predicates, DEC-10 Prolog-style input/output,
formatted output, dynamic loading of modules, activation of operators
at run-time, etc.

41 Definite clause grammars
***************************

*Author(s):* The CLIP Group.

   This library package allows the use of DCGs (Definite Clause
Grammars) [Col78,PW80] in a Ciao module/program.

   Definite clause grammars are an extension of the well-known
context-free grammars. Prolog's grammar rules provide a convenient
notation for expressing definite clause grammars. A DCG rule in
Prolog takes the general form

     `head' --> `body'.

meaning "a possible form for `head' is `body'". Both `body' and
`head' are sequences of one or more items linked by the standard
Prolog conjunction operator "`,'".

   Definite clause grammars extend context-free grammars in the
following ways:

  1. A non-terminal symbol may be any Prolog term (other than a
     variable or number).

  2. A terminal symbol may be any Prolog term. To distinguish
     terminals from non-terminals, a sequence of one or more terminal
     symbols is written within a grammar rule as a Prolog list. An
     empty sequence is written as the empty list `[]'. If the
     terminal symbols are ASCII character codes, such lists can be
     written (as elsewhere) as strings. An empty sequence is written
     as the empty list, `[]' or `""'.

  3. Extra conditions, in the form of Prolog procedure calls, may be
     included in the right-hand side of a grammar rule. Such
     procedure calls are written enclosed in `{}' brackets.

  4. The left-hand side of a grammar rule consists of a non-terminal,
     optionally followed by a sequence of terminals (again written as
     a Prolog list).

  5. Alternatives may be stated explicitly in the right-hand side of
     a grammar rule, using the disjunction operator `;', or, also, as
     traditionally in Prolog, using `|' (which is treated specially
     when this package is loaded).

  6. The cut symbol may be included in the right-hand side of a
     grammar rule, as in a Prolog clause. The cut symbol does not
     need to be enclosed in `{}' brackets.

   As an example, here is a simple grammar which parses an arithmetic
expression (made up of digits and operators) and computes its value.

     expr(Z) --> term(X), "+", expr(Y), {Z is X + Y}.
     expr(Z) --> term(X), "-", expr(Y), {Z is X - Y}.
     expr(X) --> term(X).

     term(Z) --> number(X), "*", term(Y), {Z is X * Y}.
     term(Z) --> number(X), "/", term(Y), {Z is X / Y}.
     term(Z) --> number(Z).

     number(C) --> "+", number(C).
     number(C) --> "-", number(X), {C is -X}.
     number(X) --> [C], {0'0=<C, C=<0'9, X is C - 0'0}.

   In the last rule, `C' is the ASCII code of some digit.

   The query

     ?- expr(Z, "-2+3*5+1", []).

will compute `Z'=14. The two extra arguments are explained below.

   Now, in fact, grammar rules are merely a convenient "syntactic
sugar" for ordinary Prolog clauses. Each grammar rule takes an input
string, analyses some initial portion, and produces the remaining
portion (possibly enlarged) as output for further analysis. The
arguments required for the input and output strings are not written
explicitly in a grammar rule, but the syntax implicitly defines them.
We now show how to translate grammar rules into ordinary clauses by
making explicit the extra arguments.

   A rule such as

     p(X) --> q(X).

translates into

     p(X, S0, S) :- q(X, S0, S).

   If there is more than one non-terminal on the right-hand side, as
in

     p(X, Y) -->
             q(X),
             r(X, Y),
             s(Y).

then corresponding input and output arguments are identified, as in

     p(X, Y, S0, S) :-
             q(X, S0, S1),
             r(X, Y, S1, S2),
             r(Y, S2, S).

   Terminals are translated using the built-in predicate `'C'/3'
(this predicate is not normally useful in itself; it has been given
the name `'C'' simply to avoid using up a more useful name). Then,
for instance

     p(X) --> [go,to], q(X), [stop].

is translated by

     p(X, S0, S) :-
             'C'(S0, go, S1),
             'C'(S1, to, S2),
             q(X, S2, S3),
             'C'(S3, stop, S).

   Extra conditions expressed as explicit procedure calls naturally
translate as themselves, e.g.

     p(X) --> [X], {integer(X), X>0}, q(X).

translates to

     p(X, S0, S) :-
             'C'(S0, X, S1),
             integer(X),
             X>0,
             q(X, S1, S).

   Similarly, a cut is translated literally.

   Terminals on the left-hand side of a rule translate into an
explicit list in the output argument of the main non-terminal, e.g.

     is(N), [not] --> [aint].

becomes

     is(N, S0, [not|S]) :- 'C'(S0, aint, S).

   Disjunction has a fairly obvious translation, e.g.

     args(X, Y) -->
             (   dir(X), [to], indir(Y)
             ;   indir(Y), dir(X)
             ).

translates to

     args(X, Y, S0, S) :-
             (   dir(X, S0, S1),
                 'C'(S1, to, S2),
                 indir(Y, S2, S)
             ;   indir(Y, S0, S1),
                 dir(X, S1, S)
             ).

43 Formatted output
*******************

*Author(s):* The CLIP Group.

   The `format' family of predicates is due to Quintus Prolog. They
act as a Prolog interface to the C `stdio' function `printf()',
allowing formatted output.

   Output is formatted according to an output pattern which can have
either a format control sequence or any other character, which will
appear verbatim in the output. Control sequences act as place-holders
for the actual terms that will be output. Thus
             ?- format("Hello ~q!",world).
   will print `Hello world!'.

   If there is only one item to print it may be supplied alone. If
there are more they have to be given as a list. If there are none
then an empty list should be supplied. There has to be as many items
as control characters.

   The character `~' introduces a control sequence. To print a `~'
verbatim just repeat it:
             ?- format("Hello ~~world!", []).
   will result in `Hello ~world!'.

   A format may be spread over several lines. The control sequence
`\c' followed by a <LFD> will translate to the empty string:
             ?- format("Hello \c
             world!", []).
   will result in `Hello world!'.

        - _Description:_ Print `Arguments' onto current output stream
          according to format `Format'.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Format' is an atom or string describing how the arguments
          should be formatted. If it is an atom it will be converted

     *Usage:* `format(Stream,Format,Arguments)'
        - _Description:_ Print `Arguments' onto `Stream' according to

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Format' is an atom or string describing how the arguments
          should be formatted. If it is an atom it will be converted
          into a string with `name/2'.   (format:format_control/1)

          `String' according to format `Format'. This predicate is
          similar to the format/2, but the result is stored in a
          string.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Format' is an atom or string describing how the arguments
          should be formatted. If it is an atom it will be converted

          `String' is a string (a list of character codes).
          (basic_props:string/1)


 -- REGTYPE: format_control/1:
     The general format of a control sequence is `~`N'`C''. The
     character `C' determines the type of the control sequence. `N'
     is an optional numeric argument. An alternative form of `N' is
     `*'. `*' implies that the next argument in `Arguments' should be
     used as a numeric argument in the control sequence. Example:

          ?- format("Hello~4cworld!", [0'x]).

     and

          ?- format("Hello~*cworld!", [4,0'x]).

     both produce

          Helloxxxxworld!

     The following control sequences are available.

        * ~a The argument is an atom. The atom is printed without
          quoting.

        * ~`N'c (Print character.) The argument is a number that will
          be interpreted as an ASCII code. `N' defaults to one and is
          interpreted as the number of times to print the character.

        * ~`N'e

        * ~`N'E

        * ~`N'f

        * ~`N'g

        * ~`N'G (Print float). The argument is a float. The float and
          `N' will be passed to the C `printf()' function as

               printf("%.`N'e", `Arg')
               printf("%.`N'E", `Arg')
               printf("%.`N'f", `Arg')
               printf("%.`N'g", `Arg')
               printf("%.`N'G", `Arg')

          If `N' is not supplied the action defaults to

               printf("%e", `Arg')
               printf("%E", `Arg')
               printf("%f", `Arg')
               printf("%g", `Arg')
               printf("%G", `Arg')

        * ~`N'd (Print decimal.) The argument is an integer. `N' is
          interpreted as the number of digits after the decimal
          point. If `N' is 0 or missing, no decimal point will be
          printed. Example:

               ?- format("Hello ~1d world!", [42]).
               ?- format("Hello ~d world!", [42]).

          will print as

               Hello 4.2 world!
               Hello 42 world!

          respectively.

        * ~`N'D (Print decimal.) The argument is an integer.
          Identical to `~`N'd' except that `,' will separate groups
          of three digits to the left of the decimal point. Example:

          will print as

               Hello 1,234.5 world!

        * ~`N'r (Print radix.) The argument is an integer. `N' is
          interpreted as a radix. `N' should be >= 2 and <= 36. If
          `N' is missing the radix defaults to 8. The letters `a-z'
          will denote digits larger than 9. Example:

               ?- format("Hello ~2r world!", [15]).
               ?- format("Hello ~16r world!", [15]).

          will print as

               Hello 1111 world!
               Hello f world!

          respectively.

        * ~`N'R (Print radix.) The argument is an integer. Identical
          to `~`N'r' except that the letters `A-Z' will denote digits
          larger than 9. Example:

               ?- format("Hello ~16R world!", [15]).

          will print as

               Hello F world!

        * ~`N's (Print string.) The argument is a list of ASCII
          codes. Exactly `N' characters will be printed. `N' defaults
          to the length of the string. Example:

               ?- format("Hello ~4s ~4s!", ["new","world"]).
               ?- format("Hello ~s world!", ["new"]).

          will print as

               Hello new  worl!
               Hello new world!

          respectively.

        * ~i (Ignore argument.) The argument may be of any type. The
          argument will be ignored. Example:

               ?- format("Hello ~i~s world!", ["old","new"]).

          will print as

               Hello new world!

        * ~k (Print canonical.) The argument may be of any type. The
          argument will be passed to `write_canonical/2' (*note Term
          output::). Example:

               ?- format("Hello ~k world!", [[a,b,c]]).

          will print as

               Hello .(a,.(b,.(c,[]))) world!

        * ~p (print.) The argument may be of any type. The argument
          will be passed to `print/2' (*note Term output::). Example:

          suposing the user has defined the predicate

               :- multifile portray/1.
               portray([X|Y]) :- print(cons(X,Y)).

          then

               ?- format("Hello ~p world!", [[a,b,c]]).

          will print as

               Hello cons(a,cons(b,cons(c,[]))) world!

        * ~q (Print quoted.) The argument may be of any type. The
          argument will be passed to `writeq/2' (*note Term
          output::). Example:

               ?- format("Hello ~q world!", [['A','B']]).

          will print as

               Hello ['A','B'] world!

        * ~w (write.) The argument may be of any type. The argument
          will be passed to `write/2' (*note Term output::). Example:

               ?- format("Hello ~w world!", [['A','B']]).

          will print as

               Hello [A,B] world!

        * ~`N'n (Print newline.) Print `N' newlines. `N' defaults to
          1. Example:

               ?- format("Hello ~n world!", []).

          will print as

               Hello
                world!

        * ~N (Fresh line.) Print a newline, if not already at the
          beginning of a line.

        * ~~ (Print tilde.) Prints `~'


     The following control sequences are also available for
     compatibility, but do not perform any useful functions.

        * ~`N'| (Set tab.) Set a tab stop at position `N', where `N'
          defaults to the current position, and advance the current
          position there.

        * ~`N'+ (Advance tab.) Set a tab stop at `N' positions past
          the current position, where `N' defaults to 8, and advance
          the current position there.

        * ~`N't (Set fill character.) Set the fill character to be
          used in the next position movement to `N', where `N'
          defaults to <SPC>.

     *Usage:* `format_control(C)'
        - _Description:_ `C' is an atom or string describing how the
          arguments should be formatted. If it is an atom it will be
          converted into a string with `name/2'.

        - _The following properties should hold globally:_

          Documentation is still incomplete: `format_control(C)' may
          not conform the functionality documented.

43.3 Known bugs and planned improvements (`format')
===================================================

   * `format_to_string/3' is extremelly slow in its current
     implementation. It writes an intermediate file which is
     immediately removed, if possible. It is not very fast. In case
     there are no permissions, writing is attempted through an
     internal pipe, which may hang if the string is too long (this is
     O.S. dependant).

======================================

 -- PREDICATE: sort/2:
     `sort(List1,List2)'

     The elements of `List1' are sorted into the standard order (see
     *note Comparing terms::) and any identical elements are merged,
     yielding `List2'. The time and space complexity of this
     operation is at worst `O(N lg N)' where `N' is the length of
     `List1'.

     *General properties:* `sort(A,B)'
        - _If the following properties should hold at call time:_

          term_basic:A=[1,2,6,5,2,1]  (term_basic:= /2)

          _then the following properties should hold upon exit:_

          The terms `B' and `[1,2,5,6]' are strictly identical.
          (term_compare:== /2)
     `sort(A,B)'
        - _If the following properties hold at call time:_

          `A' is a list.   (basic_props:list/1)

          _then the following properties hold globally:_

          `sort(A,B)' is evaluable at compile-time.
          (basic_props:eval/1)
     `sort(A,B)'
        - _The following properties hold globally:_

          `sort(A,B)' is side-effect `free'.   (basic_props:sideff/2)

     *Usage:*
        - _Description:_ `List2' is the sorted list corresponding to
          `List1'.

        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `List2' is a list.   (basic_props:list/1)

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `List1' is a list.   (basic_props:list/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `List2' is a list.   (basic_props:list/1)

        - _The following properties should hold globally:_

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP.
          (basic_props:native/1)


 -- PREDICATE: keysort/2:
     `keysort(List1,List2)'

     `List1' is sorted into order according to the value of the
     _keys_ of its elements, yielding the list `List2'. No merging
     takes place. This predicate is _stable_, i.e., if an element `A'
     occurs before another element `B' _with the same key_ in the
     input, then `A' will occur before `B' also in the output. The
     time and space complexity of this operation is at worst `O(N lg
     N)' where `N' is the length of `List1'.

     *Usage:*
        - _Description:_ `List2' is the (key-)sorted list
          corresponding to `List1'.

        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `List2' is a list of pairs of the form `Key-Value'.
          (sort:keylist/1)

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `List1' is a list of pairs of the form `Key-Value'.
          (sort:keylist/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `List2' is a list of pairs of the form `Key-Value'.
          (sort:keylist/1)

        - _The following properties should hold globally:_

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP.
          (basic_props:native/1)


 -- REGTYPE: keylist/1:
     *Usage:* `keylist(L)'
        - _Description:_ `L' is a list of pairs of the form
          `Key-Value'.


 -- REGTYPE: keypair/1:
     *Usage:* `keypair(P)'

   This module contains predicates for invoking services which are
typically provided by the operating system. Note that the predicates
which take names of files or directories as arguments in this module
expect atoms, not path aliases. I.e., generally these predicates will
not call `absolute_file_name/2' on names of files or directories
taken as arguments.

     sent to `Stream'. If `Mode' is `write', `Stream' is sent as
     input to the process. `Stream' may be read from or written into
     using the ordinary stream I/O predicates. `Stream' must be
     closed explicitly using `close/1', i.e., it is not closed
     automatically when the process dies. Note that `popen/2' is

     `exec(Command,StdIn,StdOut,StdErr)'

     Starts the process `Command' and returns the standart I/O
     streams of the process in `StdIn', `StdOut', and `StdErr'. If
     `Command' contains blank spaces, these are taken as separators
     between a program name (the first chunk of contiguous non-blank
     characters) and options for the program (the subsequent
     contiguous pieces of non-blank characters), as in `exec('ls -lRa
     ../sibling_dir', In, Out, Err)'.

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Command' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

     `exec(Command,StdIn,StdOut)'

     Starts the process `Command' and returns the standart I/O
     streams of the process in `StdIn' and `StdOut'. `Standard error'
     is connected to whichever the parent process had it connected
     to. `Command' is treated and split in components as in `exec/4'.

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Command' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

          `StdIn' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

          of process. `Command' is the command to be executed and
          `Arguments' is a list of atoms to be passed as arguments to
          the command. When called with free variables, `StdIn',
          `StdOut', and `StdErr' are instantiated to streams
          connected to the standard output, input, and error of the
          created process. `Background' controls whether the caller
          waits for `Command' to finish, or if the process executing
          `Command' is completely detached (it can be waited for using `wait/3').
          `ErrCode' is the error code returned by the lower-level
          `exec()' system call (this return code is system-dependent,
          but a non-zero value usually means that something has gone
          wrong). If `Command' does not start by a slash, `exec/8'
          uses the environment variable `PATH' to search for it. If
          `PATH' is not set, `/bin' and `/usr/bin' are searched.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Command' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)

        - _Description:_ wait/3 waits for the process numbered `Pid'.
          If `PID' equals -1, it will wait for any children process.
          `RetCode' is usually the PID of the waited-for process, and
          -1 in case in case of error. `Status' is related to the
          exit value of the process in a system-dependent fashion.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Pid' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)

48.4 Known bugs and planned improvements (`system')
===================================================

   * Run-time checks have been reported not to work with this code.
     That means that either the assertions here, or the code that
     implements the run-time checks are erroneous.

   * In some situations, copy_file don't work when the second
     argument is a directory, example:

     copy_file( 'site/ciaopp_online.html' , ~distdir, yes),

   * `shell/n' commands have a bug in Windows: if the environment
     variable SHELL is instantiated to some Windows shell
     implementation, then it is very possible that shell/{1,2} will
     not work, as it is always called with the -c flag to start the
     user command. For example, COMMAND.COM *might* need the flag /C
     - but there is no way to know a priori which command line option
     is necessary for every shell! It does not seems usual that
     Windows sets the SHELL environment variable: if it is not set,
     we set it up at startup time to point to the `sh.exe' provided
     with Ciao, which is able to start Windows aplications.
     Therefore, `?- shell('command.com').' just works.

   * If `exec/4' does not find the command to be executed, there is
     no visible error message: it is sent to a error output which has
     already been assigned to a different stream, disconnected from
     the one the user sees.

49.3 Known bugs and planned improvements (`prolog_sys')
=======================================================

   * The space used by the process is not measured here: process
     data, code, and stack also take up memory. The memory reported
     for atoms is not what is actually used, but the space used up by
     the hash table (which is enlarged as needed).

   * The predicate `predicate_property/2' needs more work:
        * Efficiency: In order to be complete and efficient, this
          needs to be a built-in predicate of our module system.
          Consulting predicate properties does not seem a dangerous
          operation (except that, when it cannot be resolved at
          compile-time, it prevents removal of module runtime
          information).

        * Correctness: The head is automatically module-expanded on
          call. If the head is not module-expanded, there are
          consistency problems. Other systems avoid those problems by
          disallowing the import of two predicates with the same name
          from different modules. That is clearly not a solution in
          Ciao.


   * Implement a `'$predicate_property'/2' where the module can be
     specified. That will simplify the `predicate_property/2'
     implementation

51 Quintus-like internal database
*********************************

*Author(s):* The CLIP Group.

   The predicates described in this section were introduced in early
implementations of Prolog to provide efficient means of performing
operations on large quantities of data. The introduction of indexed
dynamic predicates have rendered these predicates obsolete, and the
sole purpose of providing them is to support existing code. There is
no reason whatsoever to use them in new code.

   These predicates store arbitrary terms in the database without
interfering with the clauses which make up the program. The terms
which are stored in this way can subsequently be retrieved via the
key on which they were stored. Many terms may be stored on the same
key, and they can be individually accessed by pattern matching.
Alternatively, access can be achieved via a special identifier which
uniquely identifies each recorded term and which is returned when the
term is stored.

==============================================

 -- PREDICATE: recorda/3:
     `recorda(Key,Term,Ref)'

     The term `Term' is recorded in the internal database as the
     first item for the key `Key', where `Ref' is its
     implementation-defined identifier. The key must be given, and
     only its principal functor is significant. Any uninstantiated
     variables in the `Term' will be replaced by new private
     variables, along with copies of any subgoals blocked on these
     variables.

     *Usage:* `recorda(Key,Term,Ref)'
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Key' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `Ref' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

        - _The following properties should hold globally:_

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP.
          (basic_props:native/1)


 -- PREDICATE: recordz/3:
     `recordz(Key,Term,Ref)'

     Like `recorda/3', except that the new term becomes the _last_
     item for the key `Key'.

     *Usage:* `recordz(Key,Term,Ref)'
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Key' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `Ref' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

        - _The following properties should hold globally:_

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP.
          (basic_props:native/1)


 -- PREDICATE: recorded/3:
     `recorded(Key,Term,Ref)'

     The internal database is searched for terms recorded under the
     key `Key'. These terms are successively unified with `Term' in
     the order they occur in the database. At the same time, `Ref' is
     unified with the implementation-defined identifier uniquely
     identifying the recorded item. If the key is instantiated to a
     compound term, only its principal functor is significant. If the
     key is uninstantiated, all terms in the database are
     successively unified with `Term' in the order they occur.

     *Usage:* `recorded(Key,Term,Ref)'
        - _The following properties should hold globally:_

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP.
          (basic_props:native/1)


 -- PREDICATE: current_key/2:
     `current_key(KeyName,KeyTerm)'

     `KeyTerm' is the most general form of the key for a currently
     recorded term, and `KeyName' is the name of that key. This
     predicate can be used to enumerate in undefined order all keys
     for currently recorded terms through backtracking.

     *Usage:* `current_key(Name,Key)'
        - _The following properties should hold globally:_

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP.

   This library package allows the use of the statically defined
operators of a module for the reading performed at run-time by the
program that uses the module. Simply by using this package the

   Ciao allows _annotating_ the program code with _assertions_. Such
assertions include type and instantiation mode declarations, but also
more general properties as well as comments for _autodocumentation_
in the _literate programming_ style. These assertions document
predicates (and modules and whole applications) and can be used by
the Ciao preprocessor/compiler while debugging and optimizing the
program or library, and by the Ciao documenter to build program or
library reference manuals.

54 The Ciao assertion package
*****************************

*Author(s):* Manuel Hermenegildo, Francisco Bueno, German Puebla.

   The `assertions' package adds a number of new declaration
definitions and new operator definitions which allow including program
assertions in user programs. Such assertions can be used to describe
predicates, properties, modules, applications, etc. These
descriptions can contain formal specifications (such as sets of
preconditions, post-conditions, or descriptions of computations) as
well as machine-readable textual comments.

   This module is part of the `assertions' library. It defines the
basic code-related assertions, i.e., those intended to be used mainly
by compilation-related tools, such as the static analyzer or the
run-time test generator.

   Giving specifications for predicates and other program elements is
the main functionality documented here. The exact syntax of comments is
described in the autodocumenter ( `lpdoc' [Knu84,Her99]) manual,
although some support for adding machine-readable comments in
assertions is also mentioned here.

   There are two kinds of assertions: predicate assertions and
program point assertions. All predicate assertions are currently
placed as directives in the source code, i.e., preceded by "`:-'".
Program point assertions are placed as goals in clause bodies.

54.1 More info
==============

The facilities provided by the library are documented in the
description of its component modules. This documentation is intended
to provide information only at a "reference manual" level. For a more
tutorial introduction to the subject and some more examples please
see [PBH00]. The assertion language implemented in this library is
modeled after this design document, although, due to implementation
issues, it may differ in some details. The purpose of this manual is
to document precisely what the implementation of the library supports
at any given point in time.

54.2 Some attention points
==========================

   * *Formatting commands within text strings:* many of the
     predicates defined in these modules include arguments intended
     for providing textual information. This includes titles,
     descriptions, comments, etc. The type of this argument is a
     character string. In order for the automatic generation of
     documentation to work correctly, this character string should
     adhere to certain conventions. See the description of the `docstring/1'
     type/grammar for details.

   * *Referring to variables:* In order for the automatic
     documentation system to work correctly, variable names (for
     example, when referring to arguments in the head patterns of
     _pred_ declarations) must be surrounded by an `@var' command.
     For example, `@var{VariableName}' should be used for referring
     to the variable "VariableName", which will appear then formatted
     as follows: `VariableName'. See the description of the `docstring/1'
     type/grammar for details.

54.4 Documentation on new declarations (`assertions_doc')
=========================================================

 -- DECLARATION: pred/1:
     This assertion provides information on a predicate. The body of
     the assertion (its only argument) contains properties or
     comments in the formats defined by `assrt_body/1'.

     More than one of these assertions may appear per predicate, in
     which case each one represents a possible " mode" of use ( usage)
     of the predicate. The exact scope of the usage is defined by the
     properties given for calls in the body of each assertion (which
     should thus distinguish the different usages intended). All of
     them together cover all possible modes of usage.

     For example, the following assertions describe (all the and the
     only) modes of usage of predicate `length/2' (see `lists'):
          :- pred length(L,N) : list * var => list * integer
          	# "Computes the length of `L'.".
          :- pred length(L,N) : var * integer => list * integer
          	# "Outputs `L' of length `N'.".
          :- pred length(L,N) : list * integer => list * integer
          	# "Checks that `L' is of length `N'.".

     *Usage:* :- `pred AssertionBody'.
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `AssertionBody' is an assertion body.
          (assertions_props:assrt_body/1)


 -- DECLARATION: pred/2:
     This assertion is similar to a `pred/1' assertion but it is
     explicitely qualified. Non-qualified `pred/1' assertions are
     assumed the qualifier `check'.

     *Usage:* :- `AssertionStatus pred AssertionBody'.
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `AssertionStatus' is an acceptable status for an assertion.
          (assertions_props:assrt_status/1)

          `AssertionBody' is an assertion body.
          (assertions_props:assrt_body/1)


 -- DECLARATION: texec/1:
     This assertion is similar to a `calls/1' assertion but it is
     used to provide input data and execution commands to the
     unit-test driver.

     *Usage:* :- `texec AssertionBody'.
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `AssertionBody' is a call assertion body.
          (assertions_props:c_assrt_body/1)


 -- DECLARATION: texec/2:
     This assertion is similar to a `texec/1' assertion but it is
     explicitely qualified with an assertion status. Non-qualified `texec/1'
     assertions are assumed to have `check' status.

     *Usage:* :- `AssertionStatus texec AssertionBody'.
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `AssertionStatus' is an acceptable status for an assertion.
          (assertions_props:assrt_status/1)

          `AssertionBody' is a call assertion body.
          (assertions_props:c_assrt_body/1)


 -- DECLARATION: calls/1:
     This assertion is similar to a `pred/1' assertion but it only
     provides information about the calls to a predicate. If one or
     several calls assertions are given they are understood to
     describe all possible calls to the predicate.

     For example, the following assertion describes all possible
     calls to predicate `is/2' (see `arithmetic'):
          :- calls is(term,arithexpression).

     *Usage:* :- `calls AssertionBody'.
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `AssertionBody' is a call assertion body.
          (assertions_props:c_assrt_body/1)


 -- DECLARATION: calls/2:
     This assertion is similar to a `calls/1' assertion but it is
     explicitely qualified with an assertion status. Non-qualified `calls/1'
     assertions are assumed to have `check' status.

     *Usage:* :- `AssertionStatus calls AssertionBody'.
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `AssertionStatus' is an acceptable status for an assertion.
          (assertions_props:assrt_status/1)

          `AssertionBody' is a call assertion body.
          (assertions_props:c_assrt_body/1)


 -- DECLARATION: success/1:
     This assertion is similar to a `pred/1' assertion but it only
     provides information about the answers to a predicate. The
     described answers might be conditioned to a particular way of
     calling the predicate.

     For example, the following assertion specifies the answers of
     the `length/2' predicate _if_ it is called as in the first mode
     of usage above (note that the previous pred assertion already
     conveys such information, however it also compelled the
     predicate calls, while the success assertion does not):
          :- success length(L,N) : list * var => list * integer.

     *Usage:* :- `success AssertionBody'.
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `AssertionBody' is a predicate assertion body.
          (assertions_props:s_assrt_body/1)


 -- DECLARATION: success/2:
     success assertion This assertion is similar to a `success/1'
     assertion but it is explicitely qualified with an assertion
     status. The status of non-qualified `success/1' assertions is
     assumed to be `check'.

     *Usage:* :- `AssertionStatus success AssertionBody'.
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `AssertionStatus' is an acceptable status for an assertion.
          (assertions_props:assrt_status/1)

          `AssertionBody' is a predicate assertion body.
          (assertions_props:s_assrt_body/1)


 -- DECLARATION: test/1:
     This assertion is similar to a success assertion but it
     specifies a concrete test case to be run in order verify
     (partially) that the predicate is working as expected. For
     example, the following test will verify that the length
     predicate works well for the particular list given:
          :- test length(L,N) : ( L = [1,2,5,2] ) => ( N = 4 ).

     *Usage:* :- `test AssertionBody'.
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `AssertionBody' is a predicate assertion body.
          (assertions_props:s_assrt_body/1)


 -- DECLARATION: test/2:
     This assertion is similar to a `test/1' assertion but it is
     explicitely qualified with an assertion status. Non-qualified `test/1'
     assertions are assumed to have `check' status. In this context,
     check means that the test should be executed when the developer
     runs the test battery.

     *Usage:* :- `AssertionStatus test AssertionBody'.
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `AssertionStatus' is an acceptable status for an assertion.
          (assertions_props:assrt_status/1)

          `AssertionBody' is a predicate assertion body.
          (assertions_props:s_assrt_body/1)


 -- DECLARATION: comp/1:
     This assertion is similar to a `pred/1' assertion but it only
     provides information about the global execution properties of a
     predicate (note that such kind of information is also conveyed
     by pred assertions). The described properties might be
     conditioned to a particular way of calling the predicate.

     For example, the following assertion specifies that the
     computation of `append/3' (see `lists') will not fail _if_ it is
     called as described (but does not compel the predicate to be
     called that way):
          :- comp append(Xs,Ys,Zs) : var * var * var + not_fail.

     *Usage:* :- `comp AssertionBody'.
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `AssertionBody' is a comp assertion body.
          (assertions_props:g_assrt_body/1)


 -- DECLARATION: comp/2:
     This assertion is similar to a `comp/1' assertion but it is
     explicitely qualified. Non-qualified `comp/1' assertions are
     assumed the qualifier `check'.

     *Usage:* :- `AssertionStatus comp AssertionBody'.
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `AssertionStatus' is an acceptable status for an assertion.
          (assertions_props:assrt_status/1)

          `AssertionBody' is a comp assertion body.
          (assertions_props:g_assrt_body/1)


 -- DECLARATION: prop/1:
     This assertion is similar to a `pred/1' assertion but it flags
     that the predicate being documented is also a " property."

     Properties are standard predicates, but which are _guaranteed to
     terminate for any possible instantiation state of their
     argument(s)_, do not perform side-effects which may interfere
     with the program behaviour, and do not further instantiate their
     arguments or add new constraints.

     Provided the above holds, properties can thus be safely used as run-time
     checks. The program transformation used in `ciaopp' for run-time
     checking guarantees the third requirement. It also performs some
     basic checks on properties which in most cases are enough for
     the second requirement. However, it is the user's responsibility
     to guarantee termination of the properties defined. (See also
     *note Declaring regular types:: for some considerations
     applicable to writing properties.)

     The set of properties is thus a strict subset of the set of
     predicates. Note that properties can be used to describe
     characteristics of arguments in assertions and they can also be
     executed (called) as any other predicates.

     *Usage:* :- `prop AssertionBody'.
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `AssertionBody' is an assertion body.
          (assertions_props:assrt_body/1)


 -- DECLARATION: prop/2:
     This assertion is similar to a `prop/1' assertion but it is
     explicitely qualified. Non-qualified `prop/1' assertions are
     assumed the qualifier `check'.

     *Usage:* :- `AssertionStatus prop AssertionBody'.
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `AssertionStatus' is an acceptable status for an assertion.
          (assertions_props:assrt_status/1)

          `AssertionBody' is an assertion body.
          (assertions_props:assrt_body/1)


 -- DECLARATION: entry/1:
     This assertion provides information about the _external_ calls
     to a predicate. It is identical syntactically to a `calls/1'
     assertion. However, they describe only external calls, i.e.,
     calls to the exported predicates of a module from outside the
     module, or calls to the predicates in a non-modular file from
     other files (or the user).

     These assertions are _trusted_ by the compiler. As a result, if
     their descriptions are erroneous they can introduce bugs in
     programs. Thus, `entry/1' assertions should be written with care.

     An important use of these assertions is in providing information
     to the compiler which it may not be able to infer from the
     program. The main use is in providing information on the ways in
     which exported predicates of a module will be called from
     outside the module. This will greatly improve the precision of
     the analyzer, which otherwise has to assume that the arguments
     that exported predicates receive are any arbitrary term.

     *Usage:* :- `entry AssertionBody'.
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `AssertionBody' is a call assertion body.
          (assertions_props:c_assrt_body/1)


 -- DECLARATION: exit/1:
     This type of assertion provides information about the answers
     that an (exported) predicate provides for _external_ calls. It
     is identical syntactically to a `success/1' assertion. However,
     it describes only external answers, i.e., answers to the
     exported predicates of a module from outside the module, or
     answers to the predicates in a non-modular file from other files
     (or the user). The described answers may be conditioned to a
     particular way of calling the predicate. E.g.:

          :- exit length(L,N) : list * var => list * integer.

     *Usage:* :- `exit AssertionBody'.
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `AssertionBody' is a predicate assertion body.
          (assertions_props:s_assrt_body/1)


 -- DECLARATION: exit/2:
     exit assertion This assertion is similar to an `exit/1'
     assertion but it is explicitely qualified with an assertion
     status. Non-qualified `exit/1' assertions are assumed the
     qualifier `check'.

     *Usage:* :- `AssertionStatus exit AssertionBody'.
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `AssertionStatus' is an acceptable status for an assertion.
          (assertions_props:assrt_status/1)

          `AssertionBody' is a predicate assertion body.
          (assertions_props:s_assrt_body/1)


 -- DECLARATION: modedef/1:
     This assertion is used to define modes. A mode defines in a
     compact way a set of call and success properties. Once defined,
     modes can be applied to predicate arguments in assertions. The
     meaning of this application is that the call and success
     properties defined by the mode hold for the argument to which
     the mode is applied. Thus, a mode is conceptually a "property
     macro".

     The syntax of mode definitions is similar to that of pred
     declarations. For example, the following set of assertions:

          :- modedef +A : nonvar(A) # "`A' is bound upon predicate entry.".

          :- pred p(+A,B) : integer(A) =>  ground(B).

     is equivalent to:

          :- pred p(A,B) : (nonvar(A),integer(A)) =>  ground(B)
             # "`A' is bound upon predicate entry.".

     *Usage:* :- `modedef AssertionBody'.
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `AssertionBody' is an assertion body.
          (assertions_props:assrt_body/1)


 -- DECLARATION: decl/1:
     This assertion is similar to a `pred/1' assertion but it is used
     for declarations instead than for predicates.

     *Usage:* :- `decl AssertionBody'.
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `AssertionBody' is an assertion body.
          (assertions_props:assrt_body/1)


 -- DECLARATION: decl/2:
     This assertion is similar to a `decl/1' assertion but it is
     explicitely qualified. Non-qualified `decl/1' assertions are
     assumed the qualifier `check'.

     *Usage:* :- `AssertionStatus decl AssertionBody'.
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `AssertionStatus' is an acceptable status for an assertion.
          (assertions_props:assrt_status/1)

          `AssertionBody' is an assertion body.
          (assertions_props:assrt_body/1)


 -- DECLARATION: doc/2:
     *Usage:* :- `doc(Pred,Comment)'.
        - _Description:_ Documentation . This assertion provides a
          text `Comment' for a given predicate `Pred'.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Pred' is a head pattern.
          (assertions_props:head_pattern/1)

          `Comment' is a text comment with admissible documentation
          commands. The usual formatting commands that are applicable
          in comment strings are defined by `stringcommand/1'. See the `lpdoc'
          manual for documentation on comments.
          (assertions_props:docstring/1)


 -- DECLARATION: comment/2:
     *Usage:* :- `comment(Pred,Comment)'.
        - _Description:_ An alias for `doc/2' (deprecated, for
          compatibility with older versions).

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Pred' is a head pattern.
          (assertions_props:head_pattern/1)

          `Comment' is a text comment with admissible documentation
          commands. The usual formatting commands that are applicable
          in comment strings are defined by `stringcommand/1'. See the `lpdoc'
          manual for documentation on comments.

================================================

 -- PREDICATE: check/1:
     *Usage:* `check(PropertyConjunction)'
        - _Description:_ This assertion provides information on a
          clause program point (position in the body of a clause).
          Calls to a `check/1' assertion can appear in the body of a
          clause in any place where a literal can normally appear.
          The property defined by `PropertyConjunction' should hold
          in all the run-time stores corresponding to that program
          point. See also *note Run-time checking of assertions::.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `PropertyConjunction' is either a term or a _conjunction_
          of terms. The main functor and arity of each of those terms
          corresponds to the definition of a property. The first
          argument of each such term is a variable which appears as a
          head argument.   (assertions_props:property_conjunction/1)


 -- PREDICATE: trust/1:
     *Usage:* `trust(PropertyConjunction)'
        - _Description:_ This assertion also provides information on
          a clause program point. It is identical syntactically to a `check/1'
          assertion. However, the properties stated are not taken as
          something to be checked but are instead _trusted_ by the
          compiler. While the compiler may in some cases detect an
          inconsistency between a `trust/1' assertion and the
          program, in all other cases the information given in the
          assertion will be taken to be true. As a result, if these
          assertions are erroneous they can introduce bugs in
          programs. Thus, `trust/1' assertions should be written with
          care.

          An important use of these assertions is in providing
          information to the compiler which it may not be able to
          infer from the program (either because the information is
          not present or because the analyzer being used is not
          precise enough). In particular, providing information on
          external predicates which may not be accessible at the time
          of compiling the module can greatly improve the precision
          of the analyzer. This can be easily done with trust
          assertion.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `PropertyConjunction' is either a term or a _conjunction_
          of terms. The main functor and arity of each of those terms
          corresponds to the definition of a property. The first
          argument of each such term is a variable which appears as a
          head argument.   (assertions_props:property_conjunction/1)


 -- PREDICATE: true/1:
     *Usage:* `true(PropertyConjunction)'
        - _Description:_ This assertion is identical syntactically to
          a `check/1' assertion. However, the properties stated have
          been proved to hold by the analyzer. Thus, these assertions
          often represent the analyzer output.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `PropertyConjunction' is either a term or a _conjunction_
          of terms. The main functor and arity of each of those terms
          corresponds to the definition of a property. The first
          argument of each such term is a variable which appears as a
          head argument.   (assertions_props:property_conjunction/1)


 -- PREDICATE: false/1:
     *Usage:* `false(PropertyConjunction)'
        - _Description:_ This assertion is identical syntactically to
          a `check/1' assertion. However, the properties stated have
          been proved not to hold by the analyzer. Thus, these
          assertions often represent the analyzer output.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `PropertyConjunction' is either a term or a _conjunction_
          of terms. The main functor and arity of each of those terms
          corresponds to the definition of a property. The first
          argument of each such term is a variable which appears as a
          head argument.   (assertions_props:property_conjunction/1)

55 Types and properties related to assertions
*********************************************

*Author(s):* Manuel Hermenegildo.

   This module is part of the `assertions' library. It provides the
formal definition of the syntax of several forms of assertions and
describes their meaning. It does so by defining types and properties
related to the assertions themselves. The text describes, for
example, the overall fields which are admissible in the bodies of
assertions, where properties can be used inside these bodies, how to
combine properties for a given predicate argument (e.g.,
conjunctions) , etc. and provides some examples.

==================================================

 -- REGTYPE: assrt_body/1:
     This predicate defines the different types of syntax admissible
     in the bodies of `pred/1', `decl/1', etc. assertions. Such a
     body is of the form:

                Pr [:: DP] [: CP] [=> AP] [+ GP] [# CO]

     where (fields between [...] are optional):

        * `Pr' is a head pattern ( `head_pattern/1') which describes
          the predicate or property and possibly gives some implicit
          call/answer information.

        * `DP' is a (possibly empty) complex argument property ( `complex_arg_property/1')
          which expresses properties which are compatible with the
          predicate, i.e., instantiations made by the predicate are
          _compatible_ with the properties in the sense that applying
          the property at any point would not make it fail.

        * `CP' is a (possibly empty) complex argument property ( `complex_arg_property/1')
          which applies to the _calls_ to the predicate.

        * `AP' is a (possibly empty) complex argument property ( `complex_arg_property/1')
          which applies to the _answers_ to the predicate (if the
          predicate succeeds). These only apply if the (possibly
          empty) properties given for calls in the assertion hold.

        * `GP' is a (possibly empty) complex goal property ( `complex_goal_property/1')
          which applies to the _whole execution_ of a call to the
          predicate. These only apply if the (possibly empty)
          properties given for calls in the assertion hold.

        * `CO' is a comment string ( `docstring/1'). This comment
          only applies if the (possibly empty) properties given for
          calls in the assertion hold. The usual formatting commands
          that are applicable in comment strings can be used (see `stringcommand/1').

          See the `lpdoc' manual for documentation on assertion
          comments.


     *Usage:* `assrt_body(X)'
        - _Description:_ `X' is an assertion body.


 -- PROPERTY: head_pattern/1:
     A head pattern can be a predicate name (functor/arity) ( `predname/1')
     or a term. Thus, both `p/3' and `p(A,B,C)' are valid head
     patterns. In the case in which the head pattern is a term, each
     argument of such a term can be:

        * A variable. This is useful in order to be able to refer to
          the corresponding argument positions by name within
          properties and in comments. Thus,
          `p(Input,Parameter,Output)' is a valid head pattern.

        * A variable, as above, but preceded by a " mode." This mode
          determines in a compact way certain call or answer
          properties. For example, the head pattern
          `p(Input,+Parameter,Output)' is valid, as long as `+/1' is
          declared as a mode.

          Acceptable modes are documented in `library(basicmodes)' and `library(isomodes)'.
          User defined modes are documented in `modedef/1'.  

        * Any term. In this case this term determines the
          instantiation state of the corresponding argument position
          of the predicate calls to which the assertion applies.

        * A ground term preceded by a " mode." The ground term
          determines a property of the corresponding argument. The
          mode determines if it applies to the calls and/or the
          successes. The actual property referred to is that given by
          the term but with one more argument added at the beginning,
          which is a new variable which, in a rewriting of the head
          pattern, appears at the argument position occupied by the
          term. For example, the head pattern
          `p(Input,+list(int),Output)' is valid for mode `+/1'
          defined in `library(isomodes)', and equivalent in this case
          to having the head pattern `p(Input,A,Output)' and stating
          that the property `list(A,int)' holds for the calls of the
          predicate.

        * Any term preceded by a " mode." In this case, only one
          variable is admitted, it has to be the first argument of
          the mode, and it represents the argument position. I.e., it
          plays the role of the new variable mentioned above. Thus,
          no rewriting of the head pattern is performed in this case.
          For example, the head pattern
          `p(Input,+(Parameter,list(int)),Output)' is valid for mode `+/2'
          defined in `library(isomodes)', and equivalent in this case
          to having the head pattern `p(Input,Parameter,Output)' and
          stating that the property `list(Parameter,int)' holds for
          the calls of the predicate.


     *Usage:* `head_pattern(Pr)'
        - _Description:_ `Pr' is a head pattern.


 -- REGTYPE: complex_arg_property/1:
     `complex_arg_property(Props)'

     `Props' is a (possibly empty) complex argument property. Such
     properties can appear in two formats, which are defined by `property_conjunction/1'
     and `property_starterm/1' respectively. The two formats can be
     mixed provided they are not in the same field of an assertion.
     I.e., the following is a valid assertion:

     `:- pred foo(X,Y) : nonvar * var => (ground(X),ground(Y)).'

     *Usage:* `complex_arg_property(Props)'
        - _Description:_ `Props' is a (possibly empty) complex
          argument property


 -- REGTYPE: property_conjunction/1:
     This type defines the first, unabridged format in which
     properties can be expressed in the bodies of assertions. It is
     essentially a conjunction of properties which refer to
     variables. The following is an example of a complex property in
     this format:

        * `(integer(X),list(Y,integer))': `X' has the property `integer/1'
          and `Y' has the property `list/2', with second argument
          `integer'.


     *Usage:* `property_conjunction(Props)'
        - _Description:_ `Props' is either a term or a _conjunction_
          of terms. The main functor and arity of each of those terms
          corresponds to the definition of a property. The first
          argument of each such term is a variable which appears as a
          head argument.


 -- REGTYPE: property_starterm/1:
     This type defines a second, compact format in which properties
     can be expressed in the bodies of assertions. A `property_starterm/1'
     is a term whose main functor is `*/2' and, when it appears in an
     assertion, the number of terms joined by `*/2' is exactly the
     arity of the predicate it refers to. A similar series of
     properties as in `property_conjunction/1' appears, but the arity
     of each property is one less: the argument position to which
     they refer (first argument) is left out and determined by the
     position of the property in the `property_starterm/1'. The idea
     is that each element of the `*/2' term corresponds to a head
     argument position. Several properties can be assigned to each
     argument position by grouping them in curly brackets. The
     following is an example of a complex property in this format:

        * ` integer * list(integer)': the first argument of the
          procedure (or function, or ...) has the property `integer/1'
          and the second one has the property `list/2', with second
          argument `integer'.

        * ` {integer,var} * list(integer)': the first argument of the
          procedure (or function, or ...) has the properties `integer/1'
          and `var/1' and the second one has the property `list/2',
          with second argument `integer'.


     *Usage:* `property_starterm(Props)'
        - _Description:_ `Props' is either a term or several terms
          separated by `*/2'. The main functor of each of those terms
          corresponds to that of the definition of a property, and
          the arity should be one less than in the definition of such
          property. All arguments of each such term are ground.


 -- REGTYPE: complex_goal_property/1:
     `complex_goal_property(Props)'

     `Props' is a (possibly empty) complex goal property. Such
     properties can be either a term or a _conjunction_ of terms. The
     main functor and arity of each of those terms corresponds to the
     definition of a property. Such properties apply to all
     executions of all goals of the predicate which comply with the
     assertion in which the `Props' appear.

     The arguments of the terms in `Props' are implicitely augmented
     with a first argument which corresponds to a goal of the
     predicate of the assertion in which the `Props' appear. For
     example, the assertion
               :- comp var(A) + not_further_inst(A).
     has property `not_further_inst/1' as goal property, and
     establishes that in all executions of `var(A)' it should hold
     that `not_further_inst(var(A),A)'.

     *Usage:* `complex_goal_property(Props)'
        - _Description:_ `Props' is either a term or a _conjunction_
          of terms. The main functor and arity of each of those terms
          corresponds to the definition of a property. A first
          implicit argument in such terms identifies goals to which
          the properties apply.


 -- PROPERTY: nabody/1:
     *Usage:* `nabody(ABody)'
        - _Description:_ `ABody' is a normalized assertion body.


 -- REGTYPE: dictionary/1:
     *Usage:* `dictionary(D)'
        - _Description:_ `D' is a dictionary of variable names.

          empty) properties given for calls in the assertion hold.

        * `CO' is a comment string ( `docstring/1'). This comment
          only applies if the (possibly empty) properties given for

     where:

          the predicate or property and possibly gives some implicit
          call/answer information.

        * `CP' is a (possibly empty) complex argument property ( `complex_arg_property/1')
          which applies to the _calls_ to the predicate.

        * `GP' contains (possibly empty) complex goal property ( `complex_goal_property/1')
          which applies to the _whole execution_ of a call to the

          properties given for calls in the assertion hold.

        * `CO' is a comment string ( `docstring/1'). This comment
          only applies if the (possibly empty) properties given for

56 Declaring regular types
**************************

*Author(s):* Manuel Hermenegildo, Pedro Lo'pez, Francisco Bueno.

   This library package adds declarations and new operator
definitions which provide simple syntactic sugar to write regular
type definitions in source code. Regular types are just properties
which have the additional characteristic of being regular types ( `basic_props:regtype/1'),
defined below.

   For example, this library package allows writing:
        :- regtype tree(X) # "`X' is a tree.".
   instead of the more cumbersome:
        :- prop tree(X) + regtype # "`X' is a tree.".

   Regular types can be used as properties to describe predicates and
play an essential role in program debugging (see the Ciao Prolog
preprocessor (`ciaopp') manual).

   In this chapter we explain some general considerations worth
taking into account when writing properties in general, not just
regular types.

56.1 Defining properties
========================

Given the classes of assertions in the Ciao assertion language, there
are two fundamental classes of properties. Properties used in
assertions which refer to execution states (i.e., `calls/1',
`success/1', and the like) are called _properties of execution
states_. Properties used in assertions related to computations (i.e.,
`comp/1') are called _properties of computations_. Different
considerations apply when writing a property of the former or of the
later kind.

   Consider a definition of the predicate `string_concat/3' which
concatenates two character strings (represented as lists of ASCII
codes):
     string_concat([],L,L).
     string_concat([X|Xs],L,[X|NL]):- string_concat(Xs,L,NL).

   Assume that we would like to state in an assertion that each
argument "is a list of integers." However, we must decide which one
of the following two possibilities we mean exactly: "the argument is
_instantiated_ to a list of integers" (let us call this property
`instantiated_to_intlist/1'), or "if any part of the argument is
instantiated, this instantiation must be compatible with the argument
being a list of integers" (we will call this property
`compatible_with_intlist/1'). For example,
`instantiated_to_intlist/1' should be true for the terms `[]' and
`[1,2]', but should not for `X', `[a,2]', and `[X,2]'. In turn,
`compatible_with_intlist/1' should be true for `[]', `X', `[1,2]',
and `[X,2]', but should not be for `[X|1]', `[a,2]', and `1'. We
refer to properties such as `instantiated_to_intlist/1' above as _instantiation
properties_ and to those such as `compatible_with_intlist/1' as _compatibility
properties_ (corresponding to the traditional notions of
"instantiation types" and "compatibility types").

   It turns out that both of these notions are quite useful in
practice. In the example above, we probably would like to use
`compatible_with_intlist/1' to state that on success of
`string_concat/3' all three argument must be compatible with lists of
integers in an assertion like:

     :- success string_concat(A,B,C) => ( compatible_with_intlist(A),
                                          compatible_with_intlist(B),
                                          compatible_with_intlist(C) ).

   With this assertion, no error will be flagged for a call to
`string_concat/3' such as `string_concat([20],L,R)', which on success
produces the resulting atom `string_concat([20],L,[20|L])', but a
call `string_concat([],a,R)' would indeed flag an error.

   On the other hand, and assuming that we are running on a Prolog
system, we would probably like to use `instantiated_to_intlist/1' for
`sumlist/2' as follows:

     :- calls sumlist(L,N) : instantiated_to_intlist(L).

     sumlist([],0).
     sumlist([X|R],S) :- sumlist(R,PS), S is PS+X.

to describe the type of calls for which the program has been
designed, i.e., those in which the first argument of `sumlist/2' is
indeed a list of integers.

   The property `instantiated_to_intlist/1' might be written as in
the following (Prolog) definition:

     :- prop instantiated_to_intlist/1.

     instantiated_to_intlist(X) :-
            nonvar(X), instantiated_to_intlist_aux(X).

     instantiated_to_intlist_aux([]).
     instantiated_to_intlist_aux([X|T]) :-
            integer(X), instantiated_to_intlist(T).

   (Recall that the Prolog builtin `integer/1' itself implements an
instantiation check, failing if called with a variable as the
argument.)

   The property `compatible_with_intlist/1' might in turn be written
as follows (also in Prolog):

     :- prop compatible_with_intlist/1.

     compatible_with_intlist(X) :- var(X).
     compatible_with_intlist(X) :-
            nonvar(X), compatible_with_intlist_aux(X).

     compatible_with_intlist_aux([]).
     compatible_with_intlist_aux([X|T]) :-
            int_compat(X), compatible_with_intlist(T).

     int_compat(X) :- var(X).
     int_compat(X) :- nonvar(X), integer(X).

   Note that these predicates meet the criteria for being properties
and thus the `prop/1' declaration is correct.

   Ensuring that a property meets the criteria for "not affecting the
computation" can sometimes make its coding somewhat tedious. In some
ways, one would like to be able to write simply:

     intlist([]).
     intlist([X|R]) :- int(X), intlist(R).

(Incidentally, note that the above definition, provided that it suits
the requirements for being a property and that `int/1' is a regular
type, meets the criteria for being a regular type. Thus, it could be
declared `:- regtype intlist/1'.)

   But note that (independently of the definition of `int/1') the
definition above is not the correct instantiation check, since it
would succeed for a call such as `intlist(X)'. In fact, it is not
strictly correct as a compatibility property either, because, while
it would fail or succeed as expected, it would perform instantiations
(e.g., if called with `intlist(X)' it would bind `X' to `[]'). In
practice, it is convenient to provide some run-time support to aid in
this task.

   The run-time support of the Ciao system (see *note Run-time
checking of assertions::) ensures that the execution of properties is
performed in such a way that properties written as above can be used
directly as instantiation checks. Thus, writing:

     :- calls sumlist(L,N) : intlist(L).

has the desired effect. Also, the same properties can often be used
as compatibility checks by writing them in the assertions as
`compat(Property)' (`basic_props:compat/1'). Thus, writing:

     :- success string_concat(A,B,C) => ( compat(intlist(A)),
                                          compat(intlist(B)),
                                          compat(intlist(C)) ).

also has the desired effect.

   As a general rule, the properties that can be used directly for
checking for compatibility should be _downwards closed_, i.e., once
they hold they will keep on holding in every state accessible in
forwards execution. There are certain predicates which are inherently
_instantiation_ checks and should not be used as _compatibility_
properties nor appear in the definition of a property that is to be
used with `compat'. Examples of such predicates (for Prolog) are
`==', `ground', `nonvar', `integer', `atom', `>', etc. as they
require a certain instantiation degree of their arguments in order to
succeed.

   In contrast with properties of execution states, _properties of
computations_ refer to the entire execution of the call(s) that the
assertion relates to. One such property is, for example, `not_fail/1'
(note that although it has been used as in `:- comp append(Xs,Ys,Zs)
+ not_fail', it is in fact read as `not_fail(append(Xs,Ys,Zs))'; see
`assertions_props:complex_goal_property/1'). For this property, which
should be interpreted as "execution of the predicate either succeeds
at least once or loops," we can use the following predicate
`not_fail/1' for run-time checking:

     not_fail(Goal):-
           if( call(Goal),
               true,            %% then
               warning(Goal) ). %% else

where the `warning/1' (library) predicate simply prints a warning
message.

   In this simple case, implementation of the predicate is not very
difficult using the (non-standard) `if/3' builtin predicate present
in many Prolog systems.

   However, it is not so easy to code predicates which check other
properties of the computation and we may in general need to program a
meta-interpreter for this purpose.

56.3 Documentation on new declarations (`regtypes_doc')
=======================================================

 -- DECLARATION: regtype/1:
     This assertion is similar to a prop assertion but it flags that
     the property being documented is also a " regular type." Regular
     types are properties whose definitions are _regular programs_
     (see lelow). This allows for example checking whether it is in
     the class of types supported by the regular type checking and
     inference modules.

     A regular program is defined by a set of clauses, each of the
     form:
          p(x, v_1, ..., v_n)  :- body_1, ..., body_k.
     where:
       1. `x' is a term whose variables (which are called _term
          variables_) are unique, i.e., it is not allowed to
          introduce equality constraints between the variables of `x'.

          For example, `p(f(X, Y)) :- ...' is valid, but `p(f(X, X))
          :- ...' is not.

       2. in all clauses defining `p/n+1' the terms `x' do not unify
          except maybe for one single clause in which `x' is a
          variable.

       3. `n' >= 0 and `p/n' is a _parametric type functor_ (whereas
          the predicate defined by the clauses is `p/n'+1).

       4. `v_1', ..., `v_n' are unique variables, which are called
          _parametric variables_.

       5. Each `body_i' is of the form:

            1. `t(z)' where `z' is one of the _term variables_ and
               `t' is a _regular type expression_;

            2. `q(y, t_1, ..., t_m)' where `m' >= 0, `q/m' is a
               _parametric type functor_, not in the set of functors
               `=/2', `^/2', `./3'.

               `t_1, ..., t_m' are _regular type expressions_, and
               `y' is a _term variable_.

       6. Each term variable occurs at most once in the clause's body
          (and should be as the first argument of a literal).
          A _regular type expression_ is either a parametric variable
     or a parametric type functor applied to some of the parametric
     variables.

     A parametric type functor is a regular type, defined by a
     regular program, or a basic type. Basic types are defined in
     *note Basic data types and properties::.

     The set of regular types is thus a well defined subset of the
     set of properties. Note that types can be used to describe
     characteristics of arguments in assertions and they can also be
     executed (called) as any other predicates.

     *Usage:* :- `regtype AssertionBody'.
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `AssertionBody' is an assertion body.
          (assertions_props:assrt_body/1)


 -- DECLARATION: regtype/2:
     This assertion is similar to a `regtype/1' assertion but it is
     explicitely qualified. Non-qualified `regtype/1' assertions are
     assumed the qualifier `check'. Note that checking regular type
     definitions should be done with the `ciaopp' preprocessor.

     *Usage:* :- `AssertionStatus regtype AssertionBody'.
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `AssertionStatus' is an acceptable status for an assertion.
          (assertions_props:assrt_status/1)

          `AssertionBody' is an assertion body.
          (assertions_props:assrt_body/1)

57.2 Documentation on exports (`native_props')
==============================================

 -- PROPERTY: clique/1:
     `clique(X)'

     `X' is a set of variables of interest, much the same as a
     sharing group but `X' represents all the sharing groups in the
     powerset of those variables. Similar to a sharing group, a
     clique is often translated to `ground/1', `indep/1', and `indep/2'
     properties.

     *Usage:* `clique(X)'
        - _Description:_ The clique pattern is ``X''.

        - _The following properties should hold globally:_

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP as
          `clique(X)'.   (basic_props:native/2)


 -- PROPERTY: clique_1/1:
     `clique_1(X)'

     `X' is a set of variables of interest, much the same as a
     sharing group but `X' represents all the sharing groups in the
     powerset of those variables but disregarding the singletons.
     Similar to a sharing group, a clique_1 is often translated to `ground/1', `indep/1',
     and `indep/2' properties.

     *Usage:* `clique_1(X)'
        - _Description:_ The 1-clique pattern is ``X''.

        - _The following properties should hold globally:_

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP as
          `clique_1(X)'.   (basic_props:native/2)


 -- PROPERTY: constraint/1:
     `constraint(C)'

     most one solution, or do not terminate. In other words, if `X'
     succeeds, it can only succeed once. It can still leave choice
     points after its execution, but when backtracking into these, it
     can only fail or go into an infinite loop.

     _Meta-predicate_ with arguments: `is_det(goal)'.

        - _Description:_ `X' is instantiated to a linear term.

        - _The following properties hold globally:_

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP.
          (basic_props:native/1)


 -- PROPERTY: mshare/1:
     `mshare(X)'

     `X' contains all _sharing sets_ [JL88,MH89] which specify the
     possible variable occurrences in the terms to which the
     variables involved in the clause may be bound. Sharing sets are
     a compact way of representing groundness of variables and
     dependencies between variables. This representation is however
     generally difficult to read for humans. For this reason, this
     information is often translated to `ground/1', `indep/1' and `indep/2'
     properties, which are easier to read.

     *Usage:* `mshare(X)'
        - _Description:_ The sharing pattern is ``X''.

          non-deterministic.


 -- PROPERTY: nonground/1:
     *Usage:* `nonground(X)'
        - _Description:_ ``X'' is not ground.

        - _The following properties should hold globally:_

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP as

*Author(s):* Manuel Hermenegildo.

   This file defines a number of very simple " modes" which are
frequently useful in programs. These correspond to the modes used in
classical Prolog texts with some simple addtions. Note that some of
these modes use the same symbol as one of the ISO-modes (see *note
ISO-Prolog modes::) but with subtly different meaning.

60 Run-time checking of assertions
**********************************

*Author(s):* Edison Mera.

   This package provides a complete implementation of run-time checks
of predicate assertions. The program is instrumented to check such
assertions at run time, and in case a property does not hold, the
error is reported. Note that there is also an older package called
rtchecks, by David Trallero. The advantage of this one is that it can
be used independently of CiaoPP and also has updated functionality.

   There are two main applications of run-time checks:

   * To improve debugging of certain predicates, specifying some
     expected behavior that is checked at run-time with the
     assertions.

   * To avoid manual implementation of run-time checks that should be
     done in some predicates, leaving the code clean and
     understandable.


   The run-time checks can be configured using prolog flags. Below we
itemize the valid prolog flags with its values and a brief
explanation of the meaning:

   * `rtchecks_level'
        * `exports': Only use rtchecks for external calls of the
          exported predicates.

        * `inner' : Use also rtchecks for internal calls. Default.

   * `rtchecks_trust'
        * `no' : Disable rtchecks for trust assertions.

        * `yes' : Enable rtchecks for trust assertions. Default.

   * `rtchecks_entry'
        * `no' : Disable rtchecks for entry assertions.

        * `yes' : Enable rtchecks for entry assertions. Default.

   * `rtchecks_exit'
        * `no' : Disable rtchecks for exit assertions.

        * `yes' : Enable rtchecks for exit assertions. Default.

   * `rtchecks_test'
        * `no' : Disable rtchecks for test assertions. Default.

        * `yes' : Enable rtchecks for test assertions. Used for
          debugging purposes, but is better to use the unittest
          library.

   * `rtchecks_inline'
        * `no' : Instrument rtchecks using call to library predicates
          present in `rtchecks_rt.pl', `nativeprops.pl' and `basic_props.pl'.
          In this way, space is saved, but sacrifying performance due
          to usage of meta calls and external methods in the
          libraries. Default.

        * `yes' : Expand library predicates inline as far as
          possible. In this way, the code is faster, because its
          avoids metacalls and usage of external methods, but the
          final executable could be bigger.

   * `rtchecks_asrloc' Controls the usage of locators for the
     assertions in the error messages. The locator says the file and
     lines that contains the assertion that had failed. Valid values
     are:
        * `no' : Disabled.

        * `yes' : Enabled. Default.

   * `rtchecks_predloc' Controls the usage of locators for the
     predicate that caused the run-time check error. The locator says
     the first clause of the predicate that the violated assertion
     refers to.
        * `no' : Disabled.

        * `yes' : Enabled, Default.

   * `rtchecks_callloc'
        * `no' : Do not show the stack of predicates that caused the
          failure

        * `predicate': Show the stack of predicates that caused the
          failure. Instrument it in the predicate. Default.

        * `literal' : Show the stack of predicates that caused the
          failure. Instrument it in the literal. This mode provides
          more information, because reports also the literal in the
          body of the predicate.

   * `rtchecks_namefmt'
        * `long' : Show the name of predicates, properties and the
          values of the variables

        * `short' : Only show the name of the predicate in a reduced
          format. Default.

61 Unit Testing Library
***********************

*Author(s):* Edison Mera.

   This library provides an extension of the Ciao assertion language
which allows writing _unit tests_. The central idea is to use the
assertion language to provide specifications of test cases for a
given predicate. The package also provides some special properties
that are convenient when specifying unit tests and the required
run-time libraries.

   In general, a _test assertion_ is written as follows:

     :- test predicate(A1, A2, ..., An)
        :  <Precondition>
        => <Postcondition>
        +  <Global properties>
        #  <Comment>.

   Where the fields of the test assertion have the usual meaning in
Ciao assertions, i.e., they contain conjunctions of properties which
must hold at certain points in the execution. Here we give a somewhat
more operational ("test oriented"), reading to these fields: `predicate/n'
is the predicate to be tested. `Precondition' is a goal that is
called before the predicate being tested, and can be used to generate
values of the input parameters. `Postcondition' is a goal that should
succeed after `predicate/n' has been called. The idea appears to be
simple, but note that due to the non-determinism of logic programs,
the test engine needs to test all the solutions that can be tested up
to given limits (for example, a maximum number of solutions, or a
given time-out). `Properties' specifies some global properties that
the predicate should meet, for example, `not_fails' means that the
program does not fail, `exception(error(a,b))' means that the program
should throw the exception `error(a,b)', and so on. But there are
some specific properties that only applies to testing specified in
the module unittest_props.pl, for example `times(N)' specifies that
the given test should be executed N times, `try_sols(N)' specifies
that the first N solutions of the predicate `predicate/n' are tested.
`Comment' is a string that document the test.

   A convenient way to run these tests is by selecting options in the
CiaoDbg menu within the development environment: 

  1. `Run tests in current module': execute only the tests specified
     in the current module.

  2. `Run tests in all related modules': execute the tests specified
     in the module and in all the modules being used by this.

  3. `Show untested predicates': show the _exported_ predicates that
     do not have any test assertion.

61.1 Additional notes
=====================

  1. The test assertions allow performing _unit_ testing, i.e., in
     Ciao, performing tests _at the predicate level_.

  2. The tests currently can only be applied to exported predicates.

  3. If you need to write tests for predicates that are spread over
     several modules, but work together, then it is best to create a
     separate module, and reexport to the predicates required to
     build the test. This allows performing _integration testing_,
     using the same syntax of the unit tests.

  4. The Ciao system includes a good (and growing) number of unit
     tests. To run all the tests among the other standard tests
     within the CiaoDE run the following (at the top level of the
     source tree):

          ./ciaosetup runtests

63 Analytic benchmarks
**********************

*Author(s):* Manuel Carro (adapted to Ciao Prolog).

   This module provides a set of analytic benchmarks which try to
isolate and measure the speed of certain very common operations in a
Prolog system. The benchmarks come from a variety of sources, mostly
within former ECRC (please look at the comments in the source code)
and were posted by Jean-Claude Syre on 24th June 1986 to the Prolog
Digest. Further packaging was done by Thoma Sjoland and SICS. They
were adapted to Ciao Prolog by Manuel Carro, by:

   * Changing the syntax to Ciao Prolog, when needed, including
     extensive use of higher-order programming for the benchmarking
     loops.

   * Adapting the size of the benchmarks and the number of
     repetitions to fit modern computers and Prolog compilation.

   * Changing the format of the output and recording performance data
     in the incore database.

   * Changing benchmarking loops to be failure-driven.

   * Adding a void initial dry run to heat up the caches.


   The comments corresponding to the *original* programs follow. They
have been largely unchanged, except to reflect changes in the program
interface necessary to perform the modularization and to adapt them
to Ciao Prolog. Of course the number of repeated calls was changed.
The original comments are still in the source files.

63.1 Testing Calls
==================

This is the one you always dreamed to test! Like all benchmarks, it
uses a loop calling the actual benchmark program. The benchmark
program consists of a sequence of 200 predicates having no arguments,
no choice points, NOTHING. 200 is chosen to have sufficient accuracy
in measuring the execution time.

   The results show the effect of pure calls, and the Klips
performance can be called the peak performance of the prolog system.
Note that the peak performance has very little significance to
classify the overall performance of a Prolog system.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Testing non-deterministic behavior,  Next: Testing environment handling,  Prev: Testing Calls,  Up: Analytic benchmarks

63.2 Testing non-deterministic behavior
=======================================

This program contains a series of 3 different benchmark predicates.

   The predicate `choice_point/1' tests calls invoking the creation
of a choice point, i.e. a branch point where the execution will
possibly come back to in case of backtracking. It does NOT backtrack.
Two versions are proposed, one with and the other without arguments.

   We then present two predicates to evaluate the mechanism of
backtracking during execution. Both predicates create one
choice_point and then backtrack 20 times on every loop iteration step.  `baktrak1/1'
exhibits a kind of backtracking called _deep_, while `baktrak2/1'
deals with _shallow_ backtracking. Both are worth being tried,
whatever your particular Prolog System is.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Testing environment handling,  Next: Testing indexing mechanisms,  Prev: Testing non-deterministic behavior,  Up: Analytic benchmarks

63.3 Testing environment handling
=================================

The creation and deletion of environments are an important feature in
prolog machines. The following program attempts to evaluate that. A
usual condition to have environments is that the clause is made of
several goals. Thus there will be calls in the clause creating
environments, and some work to set the parameters of each call. Three
arguments per goal were chosen because this number comes close to the
average number of arguments of a predicate and to the average number
of permanent variables in an environment. The arguments were arranged
in different orders for every goal, because we did not want to
measure the merits of register transfer optimisations. Note that
these transfers exist, so the results cannot be compared with those
given by the program which creates choice points (generally slower).

   Another version, `envir0ar/1', with 0 argument in each call, can
also be usefully tried


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Testing indexing mechanisms,  Next: Testing unification,  Prev: Testing environment handling,  Up: Analytic benchmarks

63.4 Testing indexing mechanisms
================================

We give only one test for indexing, i.e. the selection of a clause
due to the type of an argument. This program does not test the merits
of indexing on an argument other than the first one. It does not test
for multiple indexing either. It does not show the inefficiency which
occurs if 2 choice points per clause are created. This may happen
e.g. in Warren's indexing scheme.

   Each of these tests would require an extra benchmark program. The
program given below tests the main point in indexing. Right now we
think it is not worth adding all this complexity to the benchmarks,
in order to measure all the details in indexing. Therefore we give
only this single test.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Testing unification,  Next: Testing dereferencing,  Prev: Testing indexing mechanisms,  Up: Analytic benchmarks

63.5 Testing unification
========================

We have 6 programs to evaluate the process of unification in the
Prolog system:

   * Test of list construction via unification.

   * Test of list matching unification.

   * Test of structure construction via unification This program is
     equivalent to construct_list, except that it uses the standard
     structure representation instead of the simplified list notation.

   * Test of structure matching via unification. This predicate
     matches a list of 100 elements in structure notation.

   * Test to match a nested structure. This predicate tests the
     (compiled) unification of a complex structure.

   * Test of general unification of 2 complex structures. This
     predicate tests general unification. We call it general
     unification, because it cannot be analysed at compile time.
     Therefore this kind of unification cannot be compiled and, even
     in a compiled system, it must be handled at run time, exactly as
     by an interpreter. This is done by a general procedure for
     unification. The name of the benchmark therefore does not
     reflect that the unification is general, i.e. including all
     Prolog types (e.g. it does not contain variables), but it
     reflects the use of the procedure for general unification as
     opposed to specific, compiled unification.


   _Manuel Carro: note that in this case the term "Logical Inference"
is a bit contrived, since by design some of these (head) unifications
are very more compled, naturally being slower and giving slow KLIPS
results._

63.6 Testing dereferencing
==========================

Program to benchmark the dereferencing speed. It constructs a list
containing 500 variables which are then bound together. Since
different systems use different strategies for binding variables on
the global stack, the whole is made for two lists and the long
variable chain is created only in one of them.

   _Manuel Carro: different results in this benchmark are not likely
to affect larger, general programs. It is a well-known fact that n
programs tend not to generate long dereferencing chains. Empirical
measurements show that dereference chains of length greater than
three are extremely rare. So a suboptimal / optimal behavior in this
test is not likely to affect greatly the overall speed of a system._

63.7 Testing the cut
====================

It seems almost impossible to isolate the cut operator in a simple
test program. However, the cut-testing program in this benchmark set
contains a lot of cut at exec time. It may be regarded as a partial
test of cut, and may be worthwhile for some software implementations
of Prolog.  `cuttest/1' calls the cutit11 predicate, which performs
100 calls to a predicate cutt1 where a cut operator appears in the
second clause. Having indexing makes the evaluation of the cut more
accurate, so please indicate in our result whether or not your Prolog
system uses indexing, to clarify the comparison with others.

63.8 Assorted small programs
============================

Here we deal with prolog programs that do something, while being
still small but representative of some well-known Prolog
computations. This set should be augmented by other programs, some of
them might come from your ideas.

   Some of the following programs were taken from the Berkeley paper
by Peter Van Roy "A Prolog Compiler for the PLM". Other programs were
kindly donated by the following ECRC members: Helmut Simonis, Mehmet
Dincbas, Micha Meier and Pascal Van Hentenryck.

   The programs have been statically analysed and they represent
fairly standard programs as far as the statistical averages are
concerned. That is the arity of most clauses is 2 or 3 and there are
usually 2 or 3 clauses per predicate. The programs range from fairly
trivial programs like fibonacci series to problems such as
Hamiltonian graph traversal.

   Also, some more programs have been added since the last release
and some corrections have been made. Most of the writes were removed
in order to reduce i/o activity.

   The programs added were symbolic differentiation (from Warren's
paper) and a quick sort algorithm using difference lists. The last
addition is a bit of a rogue: its a naive reverse, where one can
enter the list length. The list gets constructed and then gets
reversed.

   We are grateful to Saumya Debray from Stony Brook and others for
comments, suggestions, feedback and useful inputs.

   These benchmarks were run on a VAX 785 with 8 Meg of memory, under
4.2 BSD Unix. The interpreter was C-Prolog version 1.5.

=======================================

 -- PREDICATE: main/1:
     *Usage:* `main(Flags)'
        - _Description:_ Main entry point. Execute all benchmarks and
          report on the performance obtained. This makes it easy to
          run the set of benchmarks as an executable. Its behavior
          regarding printing gathered data can be controlled with the
          list of flags passed as argument. Data is *always* asserted
          and available to other programs through the `dump_benchmark_data/0'
          and `access_benchmark_data/8' predicates.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Flags' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `Flags' is a list of `benchmark_usage's.
          (basic_props:list/2)


 -- REGTYPE: benchmark_usage/1:
     *Usage:* `benchmark_usage(Flag)'
        - _Description:_ Options which determine what this module
          should do with the execution results when called through the `main/1'
          entry point (i.e., if compiled to an executable). It is
          defined as

               benchmark_usage('--estimation').
               benchmark_usage('--no-machine').
               benchmark_usage('--no-human').
               benchmark_usage('--send-info').
               benchmark_usage('--base-file-name').

          with the following meaning:

             * `'--no-human'': do *not* dump human-readable data.

             * `'--no-machine'': do *not* dump data as a series of
               facts (which is a machine-readable format) which can
               be saved to a file and later read back in Prolog.

             * `'--send-info'': send a mail to the Ciao developers
               with the information gathered plus a terse description
               of the machine (O.S., architecture, CPU type and
               speed). The existence of a suitable user command to
               send mail is expected. No message is sent otherwise.
               No sensible (personal, etc.) information is gathered
               or sent.

             * `--base-file-name _file-name_': use _file-name_ as a
               base to generate file with the reports this module
               generates. The machine-oriented file will have the
               `.pl' extension and the human-oriented file will have
               the `.txt' extension.


          The options aboce can be used when calling `main/1'
          predicate or as command-line options for an executable
          built from this file. Note that the default options *print*
          available data both in human-readable and machine-readable
          formats.

        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `Flag' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)


 -- PREDICATE: just_benchmarks/0:
     *Usage:*
        - _Description:_ Run the set of benchmarks in this program
          and save the speed information gathered. They can be later
          accessed using the predicates `generate_machine_file/0' or `generate_human_file/0'.


 -- PREDICATE: generate_human_file/0:
     *Usage:*
        - _Description:_ Print to standard output a human-readable
          report of the information gathered by running `just_benchmarks/0'.


 -- PREDICATE: generate_machine_file/0:
     *Usage:*
        - _Description:_ Print to standard output a machine-readable
          report of the information gathered by running `just_benchmarks/0'.


 -- PREDICATE: send_info_to_developers/0:
     *Usage:*
        - _Description:_ Send a message to the Ciao developers with a
          report of the information gathered by running `just_benchmarks/0'.


 -- PREDICATE: arithm_average/2:
     No further documentation available for this predicate.


 -- PREDICATE: geom_average/2:

=========================================

 -- PREDICATE: getopts/4:
     *Usage:* `getopts(Arguments,Opts,Matched,Rest)'
        - _Description:_ Ciao Prolog parses the command-line
          arguments of its executables and passes them as a list of
          atoms to the `main/1' predicate. Thus, a shell invocation
          such as

          `./my_program -file input.txt -file input2.txt
          --output_file out.txt -create-dir --decode --unsorte'

          makes `main/1' receive an argument such as

          `['-file', 'input.txt', '-file', 'input2.txt',
          '--output_file', 'out.txt', '-create-dir', '--decode',
          '--unsorte']'

          `getopts/4' can be used to parse such an command-line
          option list. passed in the `Arguments' parameter. `Opts' is
          a list of expected options, each option being an _option
          spec_, i.e., a term of the form `atom/arity'. For every
          `atom' a command-line option of the form `'--atom'' or
          `'-atom'' is expected, with `arity' arguments following it.
          An `arity' of zero can be omitted. For each matched option
          spec, the list `Matched' will contain a term of the form
          `atom(Arg1, Arg2, ..., Argn)', where `n = arity'. The list
          `Rest' will contain the unmatched element in `Arguments'.

          `Rest' will respect the relative order of the elements in
          `Arguments'. The matching elements in `Matched' appear in
          the same order as the options in `Opts', and for every
          option in `Opts', its matches appear in the order as they
          came in `Arguments'.

          Assuming `Arguments' is `['-file', 'input.txt', '-file',
          'input2.txt', '--output_file', 'out.txt', '-create-dir',
          '--decode', '--unsorte']', some possible uses of `getopts/4'
          follow.

             * Check that a simple option has been selected:
                    ?- getopts(Args, ['create-dir'], M, R).
                    Args = ...
                    M = ['create-dir'],
                    R = ['-file','input.txt','-file','input2.txt','--output_file',
                         'out.txt','--decode','--unsorte']

             * Which argument was given to an option expecting an
               additional value?
                    1 ?- getopts(Args, [output_file/1], M, R).
                    Args = ...
                    M = [output_file('out.txt')],
                    R = ['-file','input.txt','-file','input2.txt','-create-dir',
                         '--decode','--unsorte']

                    1 ?- getopts(Args, [output_file/1], [output_file(F)], R).
                    Args = ..
                    F = 'out.txt',
                    R = ['-file','input.txt','-file','input2.txt','-create-dir',
                         '--decode','--unsorte']

             * Extract options (and associated values) which can
               appear several times.
                    1 ?- getopts(Args, [file/1], M, R).
                    Args = ...
                    M = [file('input.txt'),file('input2.txt')],
                    R = ['--output_file','out.txt','-create-dir','--decode',
                         '--unsorte']

             * Was decoding selected?
                    1 ?- getopts(Args, [decode], [_], R).
                    Args = ...
                    R = ['-file','input.txt','-file','input2.txt','--output_file',
                         'out.txt', '-create-dir','--unsorte']

             * Was encoding selected?
                    1 ?- getopts(Args, [encoding], [_], R).
                    no

             * Was decoding *not* selected?
                    1 ?- getopts(Args, [decode], [], R).
                    no

             * Are all the options passed to the program legal
               options? If this is not the case, which option(s)
               is/are not legal?
                    1 ?- getopts(Args, [file/1, output_file/1, 'create-dir',
                                        encode, decode, unsorted], _, R).
                    Args = ...
                    R = ['--unsorte'] ?

          The complexity of `getopts/1' is currently _O(La x Lo)_,
          where _La_ is the length of the argument list and _Lo_ is
          the length of the option list.

=========================================

 -- PREDICATE: get_line/2:
     `get_line(Stream,Line)'

     Reads from `Stream' a line of text and unifies `Line' with it.
     The end of the line can have UNIX [10] or MS-DOS [13 10]
     termination, which is not included in `Line'. At EOF, the term
     end_of_file is returned.

     *Usage:* `get_line(S,L)'
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `S' is an open stream.   (streams_basic:stream/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          strings:line(L)  (strings:line/1)


 -- PREDICATE: get_line/1:
     `get_line(Line)'

     Behaves like `current_input(S), get_line(S,Line)'.

     *Usage:* `get_line(L)'
        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          strings:line(L)  (strings:line/1)


 -- REGTYPE: line/1:
     A regular type, defined as follows:
          line(L) :-
                  string(L).
          line(end_of_file).


 -- PREDICATE: write_string/2:
     `write_string(Stream,String)'

     Writes `String' onto `Stream'.

     *Usage:* `write_string(Stream,String)'
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Stream' is an open stream.   (streams_basic:stream/1)

          `String' is a string (a list of character codes).
          (basic_props:string/1)


 -- PREDICATE: write_string/1:
     `write_string(String)'

     Behaves like `current_input(S), write_string(S, String)'.

     *Usage:* `write_string(String)'
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `String' is a string (a list of character codes).
          (basic_props:string/1)


 -- PREDICATE: whitespace/2:
     `whitespace(String,Rest)'

     In a grammar rule, as `whitespace/0', represents whitespace (a
     positive number of space (32), tab (9), newline (10) or return
     (13) characters). Thus, `Rest' is a proper suffix of `String'
     with one or more whitespace characters removed. An example of
     use would be:
             attrs([]) --> ""
             attrs([N|Ns]) -->
                 whitespace,
                 attr(N),
                 attrs(Ns).

     *Usage:* `whitespace(S1,S2)'

          `S2' is a string (a list of character codes).
          (basic_props:string/1)


 -- PREDICATE: whitespace0/2:
     `whitespace0(String,Rest)'

     In a grammar rule, as `whitespace0/0', represents possible
     whitespace (any number of space (32), tab (9), newline (10) or
     return (13) characters). Thus, `Rest' is `String' or a proper
     suffix of `String' with one or more whitespace characters
     removed. An example of use would be:

             assignment(N,V) -->
                 variable_name(N), whitespace0, "=", whitespace0, value(V).

     *Usage:* `whitespace0(S1,S2)'
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          (basic_props:string/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `S2' is a string (a list of character codes).
          (basic_props:string/1)


 -- PREDICATE: string/3:
     `string(String,Head,Tail)'

     In a grammar rule, as `string/1', represents literally `String'.
     An example of use would be:

          double(A) -->
                  string(A),
                  string(A).

     *Usage 1:*
        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `String' is a string (a list of character codes).
          (basic_props:string/1)

          `Head' is a string (a list of character codes).
          (basic_props:string/1)

          `Tail' is a string (a list of character codes).
          (basic_props:string/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `String' is a string (a list of character codes).
          (basic_props:string/1)

          `Head' is a string (a list of character codes).
          (basic_props:string/1)

          `Tail' is a string (a list of character codes).
          (basic_props:string/1)

     *Usage 2:* `string(A,B,C)'

70 Accessing and redirecting the stream aliases
***********************************************

*Author(s):* Manuel Carro.

   This library allows the redefinition of the files to which the
special streams `user_input', `user_output', and `user_error' point
to. On startup they point to the standard input, standard output, and
standard error, in Unix style (Windows users may find that standard
error stream does not work properly). Changing the file pointed to is
useful for, e.g., redirecting the place to which the Prolog's
standard error stream goes from within Prolog (e.g., to start a log
file).

========================================

 -- PREDICATE: fast_read/1:
     `fast_read(Term)'

     The next term is read from current standard input and is unified
     with `Term'. The syntax of the term must agree with fast_read /
     fast_write format. If the end of the input has been reached,
     `Term' is unified with the term 'end_of_file'. Further calls to `fast_read/1'
     will then cause an error.


 -- PREDICATE: fast_write/1:
     `fast_write(Term)'

     Output `Term' in a way that `fast_read/1' and `fast_read/2' will
     be able to read it back.


 -- PREDICATE: fast_read/2:
     `fast_read(Stream,Term)'

     The next term is read from `Stream' and unified with `Term'. The
     syntax of the term must agree with fast_read / fast_write
     format. If the end of the input has been reached, `Term' is
     unified with the term 'end_of_file'. Further calls to `fast_read/2'
     will then cause an error.

     *Usage:*
        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `Term' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Stream' is an open stream.   (streams_basic:stream/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Term' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)


 -- PREDICATE: fast_write/2:
     `fast_write(Stream,Term)'

     Output `Term' to `Stream' in a way that `fast_read/1' and `fast_read/2'
     will be able to read it back.

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Stream' is an open stream.   (streams_basic:stream/1)

          `Term' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Term' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)

        - _The following properties should hold globally:_

          `Term' is not further instantiated.

74.3 Known bugs and planned improvements (`fastrw')
===================================================

   * Both `fast_read/2' and `fast_write/2' simply set the current
     output/input and call `fast_read/1' and `fast_write/1'.
     Therefore, in the event an error hapens during its execution,
     the current input / output streams may be left pointing to the
     `Stream'

===========================================

 -- PREDICATE: no_path_file_name/2:
     This predicate will extract the last item (usually the file
     name) from a given path.

     The first argument must be instantiated to a string or atom.
     Whenever the first argument is an atom, the second argument will
     be an atom. Whenever the first argument is a string, the second
     argument will be a string.

     This predicate will fail under any of the following conditions:
        * First argument is not an atom, nor a string.

        * Second argument is not the last given path item (given path
          is the first argument).

     Those are the most usual usages of no_path_file_name/2:
          ?- no_path_file_name("/home/nexusV/somefile.txt",K).

          K = "somefile.txt" ?

          yes
          ?- no_path_file_name('/home/nexusV/somefile.txt',K).

          K = 'somefile.txt' ?

          yes
          ?-

     *Usage:* `no_path_file_name(Path,FileName)'
        - _Description:_ `FileName' is the file corresponding to the
          given `Path'.

        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `Path' is an atom or a string  (filenames:atom_or_str/1)

          `FileName' is an atom or a string  (filenames:atom_or_str/1)


 -- PREDICATE: file_directory_base_name/3:
     *Usage:* `file_directory_base_name(Path,Directory,BaseName)'
        - _Description:_ Given a file path `Path', `Directory' is the
          directory part and `BaseName' is the filename part.
          `Directory' does not end in '/' unless it is just '/'.
          `Directory' is '.' if `Path' does not contain '/'.

        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `Path' is an atom or a string  (filenames:atom_or_str/1)

          `Directory' is an atom or a string
          (filenames:atom_or_str/1)

          `BaseName' is an atom or a string  (filenames:atom_or_str/1)


 -- PREDICATE: file_name_extension/3:
     This predicate may be used in two ways:
        * To create a file name from its components: name and
          extension. For instance:

               ?- file_name_extension(File,mywork,'.txt').

               File = 'mywork.txt' ?

               yes
               ?-

        * To split a file name into its name and extension. For
          Instance:
               ?- file_name_extension('mywork.txt',A,B).

               A = mywork,
               B = '.txt' ?

               yes
               ?-

     Any other usage of file_name_extension/3 will cause the
     predicate to fail. Notice that valid arguments are accepted both
     as atoms or strings.

     *General properties:* `file_name_extension(File,Name,Ext)'
        - _Description:_ This is a bug, this test must succeeds.

        - _If the following properties do not hold at call time:_

          term_basic:File=/home/user/emacs.d/dummy  (term_basic:= /2)

          _then the following properties do not hold upon exit:_

          term_basic:Name=/home/user/emacs.d/dummy  (term_basic:= /2)

          term_basic:Ext=  (term_basic:= /2)

          _then the following properties do not hold globally:_

          All calls of the form `file_name_extension(File,Name,Ext)'
          are deterministic.   (native_props:is_det/1)

          All the calls of the form
          `file_name_extension(File,Name,Ext)' do not fail.
          (native_props:not_fails/1)

     *Usage:* `file_name_extension(FileName,BaseName,Extension)'
        - _Description:_ Splits a `FileName' into its `BaseName' and
          `Extension'.

        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `FileName' is an atom or a string  (filenames:atom_or_str/1)

          `BaseName' is an atom or a string  (filenames:atom_or_str/1)

          `Extension' is an atom or a string
          (filenames:atom_or_str/1)


 -- PREDICATE: basename/2:
     `basename(FileName,BaseName)'

     `BaseName' is `FileName' without extension. Equivalent to
     `file_name_extension(FileName,BaseName,_)'. Useful to extract
     the base name of a file using functional syntax.

     *Usage:*
        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `FileName' is an atom or a string  (filenames:atom_or_str/1)

          `BaseName' is an atom or a string  (filenames:atom_or_str/1)


 -- REGTYPE: atom_or_str/1:
     *Usage:* `atom_or_str(X)'
        - _Description:_ `X' is an atom or a string


 -- PREDICATE: extension/2:
     `extension(FileName,Extension)'

     `Extension' is the extension (suffix) of `FileName'. Equivalent
     to `file_name_extension(FileName,_,Extension)'. Useful to
     extract the extension of a file using functional syntax.

     *Usage:*
        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `FileName' is an atom or a string  (filenames:atom_or_str/1)

          `Extension' is an atom or a string
          (filenames:atom_or_str/1)

76 Symbolic filenames
*********************

*Author(s):* Francisco Bueno.

   This module provides a predicate for file opening which can use
any term as an alias for the filename (i.e., symbolic filenames)
instead of the usual constants which are file system path names of
the actual files.

   The correspondence between an alias and the actual file path is
done dynamically, without having to recompile the program. It is
possible to define the correspondence via facts for `file_alias/2' in
a file declared with `multifile:alias_file/1' in the program: those
facts will be dynamically loaded when running the program.
Alternatively, the correspondence can be defined via shell
environment variables, by defining the value of a variable by the
(symbolic) name of the file to be the path of the actual file.

76.2 Documentation on exports (`symfnames')
===========================================

 -- PREDICATE: open/3:
     `open(File,Mode,Stream)'

     Open `File' with mode `Mode' and return in `Stream' the stream
     associated with the file. It is like `streams_basic:open/3', but
     `File' is considered a symbolic name: either defined by `user:file_alias/2'
     or as an environment variable. Predicate `user:file_alias/2' is
     inspected before the environment variables.

     *Usage:*
        - _Calls should, and exit will be compatible with:_

          `Stream' is an open stream.   (streams_basic:stream/1)

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `File' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)

          `Mode' is an opening mode ('read', 'write' or 'append').
          (streams_basic:io_mode/1)

        - _The following properties hold upon exit:_

          `Stream' is an open stream.   (streams_basic:stream/1)

76.3 Documentation on multifiles (`symfnames')
==============================================

 -- PREDICATE: alias_file/1:
     `alias_file(File)'

     Declares `File' to be a file defining symbolic names via `file_alias/2'.
     Anything else in `File' is simply ignored.

     The predicate is _multifile_.



 -- PREDICATE: file_alias/2:
     `file_alias(Alias,File)'

     Declares `Alias' as a symbolic name for `File', the real name of
     an actual file (or directory).

     The predicate is _multifile_.

     The predicate is of type _data_.




File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Other information (symfnames),  Prev: Documentation on multifiles (symfnames),  Up: Symbolic filenames

76.4 Other information (`symfnames')
====================================

The example discussed here is included in the distribution files.
There is a main application file which uses module `mm'. This module
reads a line from a file; the main predicate in the main file then
prints this line. The important thing is that the file read is named
by a symbolic name "`file'". The main application file declares
another file where the symbolic names are assigned actual file names:


     :- use_module(mm).

     :- multifile alias_file/1.
     alias_file(myfiles).

     main :- p(X), display(X), nl.

   Now, the file `myfiles.pl' can be used to change the file you want
to read from without having to recompile the application. The current
assignment is:


     %:- use_package([]).
     file_alias(file,'mm.pl').

so the execution of the application will show the first line of
`mm.pl'. However, you can change to:

     file_alias(file,'main.pl').

and then execution of the same executable will show the first line of
`main.pl'.

78 File locks
*************

*Author(s):* Jose' Manuel Go'mez Pe'rez, Daniel Cabeza, Manuel Carro.

   This module implements file locks: the ability to lock a fiel so
that other processes cannot access it until the file is unlocked. *It
is, however, not working.* The predicates do nothing. Proper
implementation is planned for a near future.

 -- PREDICATE: ask/2:
     `ask(Term1,Term2)'

     `Term1' and `Term2' unify without producing bindings for the
     variables of `Term1'. I.e., `instance(`Term1',`Term2')' holds.


 -- PROPERTY: instance/2:
     *Usage:* `instance(Term1,Term2)'
        - _Description:_ `Term1' is an instance of `Term2'.

        - _The following properties hold globally:_

          This predicate is understood natively by CiaoPP.
          (basic_props:native/1)


 -- PREDICATE: variant/2:
     `variant(Term1,Term2)'

     `Term1' and `Term2' are identical up to renaming.


 -- PREDICATE: most_general_instance/3:
     `most_general_instance(Term1,Term2,Term)'

     `Term' satisfies `instance(`Term',`Term1')' and
     `instance(`Term',`Term2')' and there is no term more general
     than `Term' (modulo variants) that satisfies it.


 -- PREDICATE: most_specific_generalization/3:
     `most_specific_generalization(Term1,Term2,Term)'

     `Term' satisfies `instance(`Term1',`Term')' and
     `instance(`Term2',`Term')' and there is no term less general
     than `Term' (modulo variants) that satisfies it.

81.3 Other information (`terms_check')
======================================

Currently, `ask/2' and `instance/2' are exactly the same. However,
`ask/2' is more general, since it is also applicable to constraint
domains (although not yet implemented): for the particular case of
Herbrand terms, it is just `instance/2' (which is the only ask check
currently implemented).

          representation of `T' as an acyclic term. This
          representation can be converted back to `T' using `recycle_term/2'.


 -- PREDICATE: recycle_term/2:
     *Usage:* `recycle_term(U,T)'
        - _Description:_ Given `U', a finite representation of a term
          as an acyclic term as `uncycle_term/2' produces, `T' is the
          represented term. `U' is modified by the predicate, thus to
          maintain it untouched `copy_term/2' should be used.

86 The Ciao library browser
***************************

*Author(s):* Angel Fernandez Pineda.

   The `librowser' library provides a set of predicates wich enable
the user to interactively find Ciao libraries and/or any predicate
exported by them.

   This is a simple example:

     ?- apropos('*find*').
     persdbrt_sql: dbfindall/4
     persdbrtsql: dbfindall/4
     conc_aggregates: findall/3
     linda: rd_findall/3
     vndict: find_name/4
     internals: $find_file/8
     aggregates: findall/4,findall/3

     yes
     ?-

   Librowser is specially useful when inside GNU Emacs: just place
the cursor over a librowser response and press C-cTAB in order to get
help on the related predicate. Refer to the *"Using Ciao inside GNU
Emacs"* chapter for further information.

File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Usage and interface (librowser),  Next: Documentation on exports (librowser),  Prev: The Ciao library browser,  Up: The Ciao library browser

86.1 Usage and interface (`librowser')
======================================

   * *Library usage:*

     It is not necesary to use this library at user programs. It is
     designed to be used at the Ciao _toplevel_ shell: `ciaosh'. In
     order to do so, just make use of `use_module/1' as follows:

     `use_module(library(librowser))'.

     Then, the library interface must be read. This is automatically
     done when calling any predicate at librowser, and the entire
     process will take a little moment.So, you should want to perform
     such a process after loading the Ciao toplevel:

          Ciao 0.9 #75: Fri Apr 30 19:04:24 MEST 1999
          ?- use_module(library(librowser)).

          yes
          ?- update.

     Whether you want this process to be automatically performed when
     loading `ciaosh', you may include those lines in your _.ciaorc_
     personal initialization file.

   * *Exports:*

        - _Predicates:_

          `update/0', `browse/2', `where/1', `describe/1', `system_lib/1', `apropos/1'.

   * *Other modules used:*

        - _System library modules:_

          `regexp/regexp_code', `read', `fastrw', `system', `streams', `lists'.

86.2 Documentation on exports (`librowser')
===========================================

 -- PREDICATE: update/0:
     This predicate will scan the Ciao system libraries for predicate
     definitions. This may be done once time before calling any other
     predicate at this library.

     update/0 will also be automatically called (once) when calling
     any other predicate at librowser.

     *Usage:*
        - _Description:_ Creates an internal database of modules at
          Ciao system libraries.


 -- PREDICATE: browse/2:
     This predicate is fully reversible, and is provided to inspect
     concrete predicate specifications. For example:
          ?- browse(M,findall/A).

          A = 3,
          M = conc_aggregates ? ;

          A = 4,
          M = aggregates ? ;

          A = 3,
          M = aggregates ? ;

          no
          ?-

     *Usage:* `browse(Module,Spec)'
        - _Description:_ Asocciates the given `Spec' predicate
          specification with the `Module' which exports it.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Module' is a module name (an atom)
          (librowser:module_name/1)

          `Spec' is a *Functor/Arity* predicate specification
          (librowser:pred_spec/1)


 -- PREDICATE: where/1:
     This predicate will print at the screen the module needed in
     order to import a given predicate specification. For example:
          ?- where(findall/A).
          findall/3 exported at module conc_aggregates
          findall/4 exported at module aggregates
          findall/3 exported at module aggregates

          yes
          ?-

     *Usage:* `where(Spec)'
        - _Description:_ Display what module to load in order to
          import the given `Spec'.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Spec' is a *Functor/Arity* predicate specification
          (librowser:pred_spec/1)


 -- PREDICATE: describe/1:
     This one is used to find out which predicates were exported by a
     given module. Very usefull when you know the library, but not
     the concrete predicate. For example:
          ?- describe(librowser).
          Predicates at library librowser :

          apropos/1
          system_lib/1
          describe/1
          where/1
          browse/2
          update/0

          yes
          ?-

     *Usage:* `describe(Module)'
        - _Description:_ Display a list of exported predicates at the
          given `Module'

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Module' is a module name (an atom)
          (librowser:module_name/1)


 -- PREDICATE: system_lib/1:
     It retrieves on backtracking all Ciao system libraries stored in
     the internal database. Certainly, those which were scanned at `update/0'
     calling.

     *Usage:* `system_lib(Module)'
        - _Description:_ `Module' variable will be successively
          instantiated to the system libaries stored in the internal
          database.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Module' is a module name (an atom)
          (librowser:module_name/1)


 -- PREDICATE: apropos/1:
     This tool makes use of regular expresions in order to find
     predicate specifications. It is very usefull whether you can't
     remember the full name of a predicate. Regular expresions take
     the same format as described in library `patterns'. Example:
          ?- apropos('atom_*').

          terms: atom_concat/2
          concurrency: atom_lock_state/2
          atomic_basic: atom_concat/3,atom_length/2,atom_codes/2
          iso_byte_char: atom_chars/2

          yes
          ?-

     *Usage:* `apropos(RegSpec)'
        - _Description:_ This will search any predicate specification
          `Spec' which matches the given `RegSpec' incomplete
          predicate specification.

*****************************

*Author(s):* Angel Fernandez Pineda.

   This library offers a general way to perform clause body
expansions. Goal, fact and spec translation predicates are
authomatically called when needed, while this utility navigates
through the meta-argument specification of the body itself. All
predicates within this library must be called at _second-pass
expansions_, since it uses information stored at `c_itf' library.

87.1 Usage and interface (`expansion_tools')
============================================

   * *Library usage:*

     This library is provided as a tool for those modules which
     performs source-to-source code translation, usually known as
     _code expanders_. It may be loaded as other modules using a `use_module/1'.
     Nothing special needs to be done.

   * *Exports:*

        - _Predicates:_

          `imports_meta_pred/3', `body_expander/6', `arg_expander/6'.

   * *Other modules used:*

        - _System library modules:_

          `compiler/c_itf'.

=================================================

 -- PREDICATE: imports_meta_pred/3:
     Macro provided in order to know meta-predicate specifications
     accessible from a module.

     *Usage:* `imports_meta_pred(Module,MetaSpec,AccessibleAt)'
        - _Description:_ Tells whether `MetaSpec' meta-predicate
          specification is accessible from `Module'. `AccessibleAt'
          will be binded to '-' whether meta-predicate is a builtin
          one. If not, it will be unified with the module which
          defines the meta-predicate.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Module' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

          `MetaSpec' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)


 -- PREDICATE: body_expander/6:
     This predicate is the main translation tool. It navigates
     through a clause body, when a single _goal_ appears, user-code
     is called in order to perform a translation. Whether user-code
     fails to translate the involved goal, it remains the same.
     Regardless that goal is translated or not, an argument expansion
     will be performed over all goals if applicable (see `arg_expander/6'
     predicate).

     Variable (unknown at compile time) goals will also be attempt to
     translate.

     _Meta-predicate_ with arguments: `body_expander((pred 3),(pred
     3),(pred 3),?,?,?)'.

     *Usage:*
     `body_expander(GoalTrans,FactTrans,SpecTrans,Module,Body,ExpandedBody)'
        - _Description:_ Translates `Body' to `ExpandedBody' by the
          usage of user-defined translators `GoalTrans', `FactTrans'
          and `SpecTrans'. The module where the original body appears
          must be unified with `Module' argument.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `GoalTrans' is a user-defined predicate which performs
          _goal_ meta-type translation
          (expansion_tools:goal_expander/1)

          `FactTrans' is a user-defined predicate which performs
          _fact_ meta-type translation
          (expansion_tools:fact_expander/1)

          `SpecTrans' is a user-defined predicate which performs
          _spec_ meta-type translation
          (expansion_tools:spec_expander/1)

          `Module' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

          `ExpandedBody' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)


 -- PREDICATE: arg_expander/6:
     This predicate is an auxiliary translation tool, which is used by `body_expander/6'
     predicate. It remains exported as a macro. The predicate
     navigates through the _meta-argument specification_ of a goal.
     Whether a _goal,fact or spec_ argument appears, user-code is
     called in order to perform a translation. Whether user-code
     fails to translate the involved argument, it remains the same.
     Builtins as ','/2 or ';'/2 are treated as meta-predicates
     defining _goal_ meta-arguments. When a _goal_ meta-argument is
     located, `body_expander/6' will be called in order to navigate
     through it. Notice that a _goal_ meta-argument may be unified
     with another goal defining another meta-argument, so navigation
     is required. If arguments are not known to arg_expander/6,
     translation will not occur. This is posible whether goal or
     qualifing module are variables.

     _Meta-predicate_ with arguments: `arg_expander((pred 3),(pred
     3),(pred 3),?,?,?)'.

     *Usage:*
     `arg_expander(GoalTrans,FactTrans,SpecTrans,Module,Goal,ExpandedGoal)'
        - _Description:_ Translates `Goal' to `ExpandedGoal' by
          applying user-defined translators (`GoalTrans', `FactTrans'
          and `SpecTrans') to each meta-argument present at such
          goal. The module where the original goal appears must be
          unified with `Module' argument.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `GoalTrans' is a user-defined predicate which performs
          _goal_ meta-type translation
          (expansion_tools:goal_expander/1)

          `FactTrans' is a user-defined predicate which performs
          _fact_ meta-type translation
          (expansion_tools:fact_expander/1)

          `SpecTrans' is a user-defined predicate which performs
          _spec_ meta-type translation
          (expansion_tools:spec_expander/1)

          `Module' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

          `ExpandedBody' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

**************************************************

*Author(s):* Manuel Carro.

   This module provides basic mechanisms for using concurrency and
implementing multi-goal applications.  It provides a means for
arbitrary goals to be specified to be run in a separate stack set; in
that case, they are assigned a goal identifier with which further
accesses (e.g., asking for more solutions) to the goal can be made.
Additionally, in some architectures, these goals can be assigned an
O.S. thread, separate from the one which made the initial call, thus
providing concurrency and, in multiprocessors, parallelism
capabilities.

 -- PREDICATE: eng_call/4:
     _Meta-predicate_ with arguments: `eng_call(goal,?,?,?)'.

     *Usage:* `eng_call(Goal,EngineCreation,ThreadCreation,GoalId)'
        - _Description:_ Calls `Goal' in a new engine (stack set),
          possibly using a new thread, and returns a `GoalId' to
          designate this new goal henceforth. `EngineCreation' can be
          either `wait' or `create'; the distinction is not yet
          meaningful. `ThreadCreation' can be one of `self', `wait',
          or `create'. In the first case the creating thread is used
          to execute `Goal', and thus it has to wait until its first
          result or failure. The call will fail if `Goal' fails, and
          succeed otherwise. However, the call will always suceed
          when a remote thread is started. The space and identifiers
          reclaimed for the thread must be explicitly deallocated by
          calling `eng_release/1'. `GoalId's are unique in each
          execution of a Ciao Prolog program.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Goal' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `EngineCreation' is currently a term which is not a free
          variable.   (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `ThreadCreation' is currently a term which is not a free
          variable.   (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `GoalId' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

          `Goal' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an atom or
          a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)

          `EngineCreation' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

          `ThreadCreation' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

          `GoalId' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)


 -- PREDICATE: eng_call/3:
     _Meta-predicate_ with arguments: `eng_call(goal,?,?)'.

     *Usage:* `eng_call(Goal,EngineCreation,ThreadCreation)'
        - _Description:_ Similar to `eng_call/4', but the thread (if
          created) and stack areas are automatically released upon
          success or failure of the goal. No `GoalId' is provided for
          further interaction with the goal.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Goal' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `EngineCreation' is currently a term which is not a free
          variable.   (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `ThreadCreation' is currently a term which is not a free
          variable.   (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `Goal' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an atom or
          a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)

          `EngineCreation' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

          `ThreadCreation' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)


 -- PREDICATE: eng_backtrack/2:
     *Usage:* `eng_backtrack(GoalId,ThreadCreation)'
        - _Description:_ Performs backtracking on the goal designed
          by `GoalId'. A new thread can be used to perform
          backtracking, according to `ThreadCreation' (same as in `eng_call/4').
          Fails if the goal is backtracked over by the local thread,
          and there are no more solutions. Always succeeds if
          executed by a remote thread. The engine is *not*
          automatically released up upon failure: `eng_release/1'
          must be called to that end.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `GoalId' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `ThreadCreation' is currently a term which is not a free
          variable.   (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `GoalId' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `ThreadCreation' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)


 -- PREDICATE: eng_cut/1:
     *Usage:* `eng_cut(GoalId)'
        - _Description:_ Performs a _cut_ in the execution of the
          goal `GoalId'. The next call to `eng_backtrack/2' will
          therefore backtrack all the way and fail.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `GoalId' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `GoalId' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)


 -- PREDICATE: eng_release/1:
     *Usage:* `eng_release(GoalId)'
        - _Description:_ Cleans up and releases the engine executing
          the goal designed by `GoalId'. The engine must be idle,
          i.e., currently not executing any goal.  `eng_wait/1' can
          be used to ensure this.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `GoalId' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `GoalId' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)


 -- PREDICATE: eng_wait/1:
     *Usage:* `eng_wait(GoalId)'
        - _Description:_ Waits for the engine executing the goal
          denoted by `GoalId' to finish the computation (i.e., it has
          finished searching for a solution, either with success or
          failure).

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `GoalId' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `GoalId' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)


 -- PREDICATE: eng_kill/1:
     *Usage:* `eng_kill(GoalId)'
        - _Description:_ Kills the thread executing `GoalId' (if
          any), and frees the memory used up by the stack set.
          Usually one should wait ( `eng_wait/1') for a goal, and
          then release it, but killing the thread explicitly allows
          recovering from error states. A goal cannot kill itself.
          This feature should be used with caution, because there are
          situations where killing a thread might render the system
          in an unstable state. Threads should cooperate in their
          killing, but if the killed thread is blocked in a I/O
          operation, or inside an internal critical region, this
          cooperation is not possible and the system, although
          stopped, might very well end up in a incosistent state.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `GoalId' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `GoalId' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)


 -- PREDICATE: eng_killothers/0:
     *Usage:*
        - _Description:_ Kills threads and releases stack sets of all
          active goals, but the one calling `eng_killothers'. Again,
          a safety measure. The same cautions as with `eng_kill/1'
          should be taken.


 -- PREDICATE: eng_self/1:
     *Usage:* `eng_self(GoalId)'
        - _Description:_ `GoalId' is unified with the identifier of
          the goal within which `eng_self/1' is executed.  `eng_self/1'
          is deprecated, and eng_goal_id/1 should be used instead.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `GoalId' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)


 -- PREDICATE: goal_id/1:
     *Usage:* `goal_id(GoalId)'
        - _Description:_ `GoalId' is unified with the identifier of
          the goal within which `goal_id/1' is executed.  `goal_id/1'
          is deprecated, and eng_goal_id/1 should be used instead.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `GoalId' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)


 -- PREDICATE: eng_goal_id/1:
     *Usage:* `eng_goal_id(GoalId)'
        - _Description:_ `GoalId' is unified with the identifier of
          the goal within which `eng_goal_id/1' is executed.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `GoalId' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)


 -- PREDICATE: eng_status/0:
     *Usage:*
        - _Description:_ Prints to standard output the current status
          of the stack sets.


 -- PREDICATE: lock_atom/1:
     *Usage 1:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Arg1' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

        - _The following properties hold globally:_

          The Prolog predicate `PrologName' is implemented using the
          function `ForeignName'. The same considerations as above
          example are to be applied.
          (foreign_interface_properties:foreign_low/2)

     *Usage 2:* `lock_atom(Atom)'
        - _Description:_ The semaphore associated to `Atom' is
          accessed; if its value is nonzero, it is atomically
          decremented and the execution of this thread proceeds.
          Otherwise, the goal waits until a nonzero value is reached.
          The semaphore is then atomically decremented and the
          execution of this thread proceeds.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Atom' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `Atom' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)


 -- PREDICATE: unlock_atom/1:
     *Usage 1:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Arg1' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

        - _The following properties hold globally:_

          The Prolog predicate `PrologName' is implemented using the
          function `ForeignName'. The same considerations as above
          example are to be applied.
          (foreign_interface_properties:foreign_low/2)

     *Usage 2:* `unlock_atom(Atom)'
        - _Description:_ The semaphore associated to `Atom' is
          atomically incremented.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Atom' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `Atom' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)


 -- PREDICATE: atom_lock_state/2:
     *Usage 1:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Arg1' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Arg2' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

        - _The following properties hold globally:_

          The Prolog predicate `PrologName' is implemented using the
          function `ForeignName'. The same considerations as above
          example are to be applied.
          (foreign_interface_properties:foreign_low/2)

     *Usage 2:* `atom_lock_state(Atom,Value)'
        - _Description:_ Sets the semaphore associated to `Atom' to
          `Value'. This is usually done at the beginning of the
          execution, but can be executed at any time. If not called,
          semaphore associated to atoms are by default inited to 1.
          It should be used with caution: arbitrary use can transform
          programs using locks in a mess of internal relations. The
          change of a semaphore value in a place other than the
          initialization stage of a program is *not* among the
          allowed operations as defined by Dijkstra [Dij65,BA82].

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Atom' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `Value' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `Atom' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Value' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

     *Usage 3:* `atom_lock_state(Atom,Value)'
        - _Description:_ Consults the `Value' of the semaphore
          associated to `Atom'. Use sparingly and mainly as a medium
          to check state correctness. Not among the operations on
          semaphore by Djikstra.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Atom' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `Value' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

          `Atom' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

          `Value' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)


 -- PREDICATE: concurrent/1:
     `concurrent PredName'

     The predicate named `PredName' is made concurrent in the current
     module at runtime (useful for predicate names generated
     on-the-fly). This difficults a better compile-time analysis, but
     in turn offers more flexibility to applications. It is also
     faster for some applications: if several agents have to share
     data in a stuctured fashion (e.g., the generator knows and wants
     to restrict the data generated to a set of other threads), a
     possibility is to use the same concurrent fact and emply a field
     within the fact to distinguish the receiver/sender. This can
     cause many threads to access and wait on the same fact, which in
     turns can create contention problems. It is much better to
     create a new concurrent fact and to use that new name as a
     channel to communicate the different threads.  `concurrent/1'
     can either be given a predicate spec in the form `Name/Arity',
     with `Name' and `Arity' bound, or to give a value only to
     `Arity', and let the system choose a new, unused `Name' for the
     fact.

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `PredName' is a Name/Arity structure denoting a predicate
          name:
               predname(P/A) :-
                       atm(P),
                       nnegint(A).

*Author(s):* Manuel Carro (concurrency-safeness).

   This module implements thread-safe aggregation predicates. Its use
and results should be the same as those in the aggregates library,
but several goals can use them concurrently without the interference
and wrong results (due to implementation reasons) aggregates might
lead to. This particular implementation is completely based on the
one used in the aggregates library (whose original authors were Richard
A. O'Keefe and David H.D. Warren).

 -- PREDICATE: findall/3:
     _Meta-predicate_ with arguments: `findall(?,goal,?)'.

     *Usage:* `findall(Template,Generator,List)' < * ISO * >
        - _Description:_ A special case of bagof, where all free
          variables in the `Generator' are taken to be existentially
          quantified. Safe in concurrent applications.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Generator' is currently a term which is not a free
          variable.   (term_typing:nonvar/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Template' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)

          `Goal' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an atom or
          a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)

          `Set' is a list.   (basic_props:list/1)

        - _The following properties should hold globally:_

          All calls of the form `findall(Template,Generator,List)'
          are deterministic.   (native_props:is_det/1)


 -- PREDICATE: setof/3:
     *Usage:* `setof(Template,Goal,Set)' < * ISO * >
        - _Description:_ Finds the `Set' of instances of the
          `Template' satisfying the `Generator'. The set is in
          ascending order (see `compare/3' for a definition of this
          order) without duplicates, and is non-empty. If there are
          no solutions, `setof/3' fails.  `setof/3' may succeed in
          more than one way, binding free variables in the
          `Generator' to different values. This can be avoided by
          using existential quantifiers on the free variables in
          front of the `Generator', using `^/2'. E.g., in `A^p(A,B)',
          `A' is existentially quantified. Safe in concurrent
          apllications.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

 -- PREDICATE: bagof/3:
     *Usage:* `bagof(Template,Generator,Bag)' < * ISO * >
        - _Description:_ Finds all the instances of the `Template'
          produced by the `Generator', and returns them in the `Bag'
          in the order in which they were found. If the `Generator'
          contains free variables which are not bound in the
          `Template', it assumes that this is like any other Prolog
          question and that you want bindings for those variables.
          This can be avoided by using existential quantifiers on the
          free variables in front of the `Generator', using `^/2'.
          Safe in concurrent applications.

          function `ForeignName'. The same considerations as above
          example are to be applied.
          (foreign_interface_properties:foreign_low/2)


 -- PREDICATE: connect_to_socket/3:
     *Usage:* `connect_to_socket(Host,Port,Stream)'
        - _Description:_ Calls `connect_to_socket_type/4' with
          SOCK_STREAM connection type. This is the connection type
          you want in order to use the `write/2' and `read/2'
          predicates (and other stream IO related predicates).

 -- PREDICATE: bind_socket/3:
     *Usage:* `bind_socket(Port,Length,Socket)'
        - _Description:_ Returs an AF_INET `Socket' bound to `Port'
          (which may be assigned by the OS or defined by the caller),
          and listens to it (hence no listen call in this set of
          primitives). `Length' specifies the maximum number of

 -- PREDICATE: select_socket/5:
     *Usage:*
     `select_socket(Socket,NewStream,TO_ms,Streams,ReadStreams)'
        - _Description:_ Wait for data available in a list of
          `Streams' and in a `Socket'. `Streams' is a list of Prolog
          streams which will be tested for reading. `Socket' is a
          socket (i.e., an integer denoting the O.S. port number) or a free
          variable. `TO_ms' is a number denoting a timeout. Within
          this timeout the `Streams' and the `Socket' are checked for
          the availability of data to be read. `ReadStreams' is the
          list of streams belonging to `Streams' which have data
          pending to be read. If `Socket' was a free variable, it is
          ignored, and `NewStream' is not checked. If `Socket' was
          instantiated to a port number and there are connections
          pending, a connection is accepted and connected with the
          Prolog stream in `NewStream'.

 -- PREDICATE: socket_send/2:
     *Usage:* `socket_send(Stream,String)'
        - _Description:_ Sends `String' to the socket associated to
          `Stream'. The socket has to be in connected state. `String'
          is not supposed to be NULL terminated, since it is a Prolog
          string. If a NULL terminated string is needed at the other
          side, it has to be explicitly created in Prolog.

        - _Calls should, and exit will be compatible with:_

          `Stream' is an open stream.   (streams_basic:stream/1)

          `String' is a string (a list of character codes).

 -- PREDICATE: socket_recv_code/3:
     *Usage:* `socket_recv_code(Stream,String,Length)'
        - _Description:_ Receives a `String' from the socket
          associated to `Stream', and returns its `Length'. If
          `Length' is -1, no more data is available.

        - _Calls should, and exit will be compatible with:_

          (term_typing:nonvar/1)


 -- PREDICATE: socket_shutdown/2:
     *Usage:* `socket_shutdown(Stream,How)'
        - _Description:_ Shut down a duplex communication socket with
          which `Stream' is associated. All or part of the
          communication can be shutdown, depending on the value of
          `How'. The atoms `read', `write', or `read_write' should be
          used to denote the type of closing required.

        - _Calls should, and exit will be compatible with:_

          `Stream' is an open stream.   (streams_basic:stream/1)

          `How' is a valid shutdown type.   (sockets:shutdown_type/1)

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Stream' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `How' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)

        - _The following properties hold globally:_

          The Prolog predicate `PrologName' is implemented using the
          function `ForeignName'. The same considerations as above
          example are to be applied.
          (foreign_interface_properties:foreign_low/2)


 -- PREDICATE: hostname_address/2:
     *Usage:* `hostname_address(Hostname,Address)'
        - _Description:_ `Address' is unified with the atom
          representing the address (in AF_INET format) corresponding
          to `Hostname'.

        - _Calls should, and exit will be compatible with:_

          `Hostname' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

          `Address' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Hostname' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)

        - _The following properties hold globally:_

          The Prolog predicate `PrologName' is implemented using the

92 The Ciao Make Package
************************

*Author(s):* Manuel Hermenegildo.

This package is used mainly in two main ways:

   * When writing `Makefile's for `lpmake'.

   * When writing _applications_ which use the `make' library.


In both cases, this is the package that defines the syntax and
meaning of the dependency rules used.

File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Usage and interface (make_doc),  Next: Other information (make_doc),  Prev: The Ciao Make Package,  Up: The Ciao Make Package

92.1 Usage and interface (`make_doc')
=====================================

   * *Library usage:*

        * When writing `Makefile's for `lpmake', such makefiles start
          with:

               :- module(_,_,[make]).

          or

               :- make(_,_).

          (The latter uses the feature that an undefined declaration
          at the beginning of a file is interpreted by Ciao as a `use_module/3'
          including as third argument a package with the same name,
          in this case `make'.)

        * When writing _applications_ which use the `make' package,
          then it is loaded as any other package within the
          application.


     *Note*: It is often useful to use the `fsyntax' package inside a `Makefile'
     (or when when using the `make' library in other applications).
     If both `make' and `fsyntax' are used, then `make' should appear
     *before* `fsyntax' in the list of packages.

   * *New operators defined:*

     `::/2' [978,xfy], `<-/2' [977,xfy], `<=/2' [975,xfy], `<-/1'
     [977,yf].

   * *Other modules used:*

        - _System library modules:_

          `make/make_rt'.

File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: The Dependency Rules,  Next: Specifying Paths,  Prev: Other information (make_doc),  Up: Other information (make_doc)

92.2.1 The Dependency Rules
---------------------------

The package allows defining the following types of rules:

`_TargetSuffix_ <= _SourceSuffix_ :: _SourceRoot_ :- _BodyLiterals_.'
     A rule of this form declares that in order to produce the file
     with suffix _TargetSuffix_ from a source file with the suffix
     _SourceSuffix_ and root name _SourceRoot_ the commands in
     _BodyLiterals_ must be executed. _BodyLiterals_ is a standard
     Ciao Prolog clause body, i.e., a comma-separated conjunction of
     literals. When writing the script, _SourceRoot_ is typically
     left as a variable, to be instantiated by `lpmake' when the
     script is run to the root of name of the file to be processed.
     This allows using the value of _SourceRoot_ in _BodyLiterals_.
     For example, the following rule:

          :- use_module(library(terms), [atom_concat/2]).

          dvi <= tex :: FileRoot :-
                  atom_concat(['latex ',FileRoot,'.tex'],Command),
                  system(Command).

     states that we can generate a file _File_`.dvi' if we have a
     file named _File_`.tex' and that the command to do so is `latex
     '_File_`.tex'. Thus, if this rule appears in file `Makefile.pl'
     and we issue the command `lpmake paper.dvi' the following occurs:

        * If `paper.dvi' does not exist and `paper.tex' exists, then
          `paper.dvi' is generated from `paper.tex' by issuing the
          system command `latex paper.tex'.

        * If `paper.dvi' already exists, nothing is done.

        * If `paper.tex' does not exist, an error is reported.


`_Target_ <- :- _BodyLiterals_.'
     A rule of this form declares that in order to produce the file
     _Target_ the commands in _BodyLiterals_ must be executed.
     _Target_ need not be a real file: it can also be simply the name
     of the rule, which is used to invoke it (as a procedure name).
     For example, the following rule, when the command `lpmake
     realclean' is issued, deletes temporary files in the LaTeX
     application:

          :- use_module(library(make(system_extra))).

          clean <- :-
                  ls('*aux|*log|*~',Files)
                  delete_files(Files).

`_Target_ <- _Deps_ :- _BodyLiterals_.'
     A rule of this form declares that in order to produce the file
     _Target_, first targets _Deps_ will be called (i.e., the
     elements of _Deps_ are either other targets with rules defined
     for them, or a file or files which are already present or which
     can -and will be- generated from other available files using
     other rules). Then, the commands in _BodyLiterals_ will be
     executed. _Deps_ may be one target or a list of targets. For
     example, the following rule, when the command `lpmake realclean'
     is issued, cleans all the temporary files in the LaTeX
     application (including `.dvi' and `.ps' files). It requires that
     clean be executed first:

          :- use_package(fsyntax).
          :- use_module(library(make(system_extra))).

          realclean <- clean :-
                  delete_files(~ls('*dvi|*ps')).

     The following rule states that in order to meet the target
     `view', target `paper.ps' must be available or generated. For
     example, `lpmake view' can be used to call the `ghostview'
     visualizer on `paper.ps'. Note the use of a globally defined
     _predicate_ `main' which is called in two places in the rule,
     and could be used in other rules in the same file (`main :=
     paper.' is equivalent to the fact `main(paper).' -see the `fsyntax'
     library):

          :- use_package(fsyntax).
          :- use_module(library(make(system_extra))).
          :- use_module(library(terms), [atom_concat/2]).

          main := paper.

          view <- ~atom_concat([~main,'.ps']) :-
                  system(~atom_concat(['ghostview ',~main,'.ps'])).


   In addition to these rules, the configuration file can define
normal predicates in the usual way, or import predicates from other
modules, all of which can be called from the bodies of the dependency
rules. For example, the `system_extra' library (an extension of the `system'
library) defines many system predicates in a form which makes them
very useful inside `Makefile's, specially if the `fsyntax' package is
used (see the examples below).

   If `lpmake' is called without an explicit target as argument, then
the first target rule in the Makefile is used. This is useful in that
the first rule can be seen as the default rule.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Specifying Paths,  Next: Documenting Rules,  Prev: The Dependency Rules,  Up: Other information (make_doc)

92.2.2 Specifying Paths
-----------------------

Using the `vpath/1' predicate it is possible in configuration files
to define several paths in which files related to the rules can be
located. In this way, not all files need to be in the same directory
as the configuration file. For example:

     :- use_package(fsyntax).

     vpath := '/home/clip/Systems/ciao/lib'.
     vpath := '/home/clip/Systems/ciao/library'.
     vpath := '/home/clip/Systems/lpdoc/lib'.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Documenting Rules,  Next: An Example of a Makefile,  Prev: Specifying Paths,  Up: Other information (make_doc)

92.2.3 Documenting Rules
------------------------

It is also possible to define documentation for the rules:

`target_comment(_Target_) :- _BodyLiterals_.'
     A rule of this form allows documenting the actions related to
     the target. The body (_BodyLiterals_) will be called in two
     circumstances:

        * If _Target_ is called during execution of '`lpmake'
          _commands_'.

        * When calling '`lpmake -h''.


     Using noun forms (_generation of foo_ instead of _generating
     foo_) in comments helps this dual purpose. For example, the
     following rule:

          target_comment(realclean) :-
                  display('Cleanup of all generated files.').

     will produce output in the two cases pointed out above.

`dependency_comment(_SourceSuffix_, _TargetSuffix_, _SourceRoot_) :- _BodyLiterals_.'
     Same as the previous rule, but for suffix rules. See, for
     example, the following generic rule:

          :- use_module(library(terms), [atom_concat/2]).

          dependency_comment(SSuffix,TSuffix,FileBase) :-
                  display(~atom_concat(['Generation of ',FileBase,'.',
          	        TSuffix, ' from ',FileBase,'.',SSuffix])).

92.2.4 An Example of a Makefile
-------------------------------

The following is a simple example of a Makefile showing some basic
functionality (this is `MakefileExample.pl' in the `example_simple'
directory in the `make' library.):

     %% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     :- module(_,_,[make,fsyntax]).
     :- use_module(library(make(system_extra))).
     :- use_module(library(lists), [append/3]).
     :- use_module(library(terms), [atom_concat/2]).

     :- discontiguous(comment/2).

     %% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     %% A simple target. Defines how to produce file 'hw'.

     hw <-  []    :-
              writef("Hello world", hw).

     %% A comment describing this target (see below):
     comment(hw,['Generation of file hw']).

     %% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     %% A target with a dependency. 'hwhw' requires 'hw'.

     hwhw <- [hw] :-
             readf(hw,Content),
             append(Content,[0'\n|Content],DoubleContent),
             writef(DoubleContent,hwhw).

     comment(hwhw,['Generation of file hwhw']).

     %% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     %% A simple target. Defines how to produce file 'datafile.simple'.

     'datafile.simple' <-  :-
             writef("Hello world", 'datafile.simple').

     comment('datafile.simple',['Generation of file datafile.simple']).

     %% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     %% A dependency based on suffixes:
     %% <file>.double is generated always from <file>.simple

     double <= simple :: Name :-
             readf(~atom_concat([Name,'.simple']),Content),
             append(Content,[0'\n|Content],DoubleContent),
             writef(DoubleContent,~atom_concat([Name,'.double'])).

     %% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     %% A dependency based on suffixes with a precondition.
     %% <file>.double is generated always from <file>.simple, once
     %% precond is done

     boo <- :-
             display((double <= simple :: name <- precond :- body1, body2)).

     %% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     %% Example using library predicates

     clean <- [] # "Cleanup of temporary files " :-
             delete_files(~ls('*~|*.asr|*.itf|*.po')).

     realclean <- clean :-
             delete_files(~ls('hw|hwhw|*simple|*double')).

     comment(realclean,['Cleanup of all generated files']).

     %% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     %% Reporting progress and documenting commands:
     %% If target_comment/1 is defined it can be used to produce user-defined
     %% output when targets are processed and/or documentation on what each
     %% target does (used for example when lpmake is called with -h). Using
     %% 'generation of foo' instead of 'generating foo' in comments helps in this
     %% dual purpose.
     %% -------------------------------------------------------------------------

     :- push_prolog_flag(multi_arity_warnings,off).
     %% Make calls target_comment/1 for simple targets:
     target_comment(Target) :-
             comment(Target,Comment),
             display(~atom_concat([~atom_concat(Comment), '\n'])).
     :- pop_prolog_flag(multi_arity_warnings).

     %% Similarly, make calls dependency_comment/3 for dependencies (only
     %% during execution, not when documenting -h).
     dependency_comment(SSuffix,TSuffix,FileBase) :-
             display(~atom_concat(['Generation of ',FileBase,TSuffix,
                                   ' from ',FileBase,SSuffix,'\nl'])).

   The following are a few commands that can be used on the previous
file (see file `CommandsToTry' in the `example_simple' directory in
the `make' library):


     lpmake -m MakefileExample.pl hwhw
     (Generate file hwhw --needs to generate file hw first)

     lpmake -m MakefileExample.pl datafile.double
     (Generate file datafile.double --needs to generate file
     datafile.simple first)

     lpmake -m MakefileExample.pl realclean
     (Cleanup)

     lpmake -h -m MakefileExample.pl
     (Help on general use of lpmake and commands available in MakefileExample.pl)

====================================================

   * The current handle of help messages is defficient. It must be in
     a standar form, and the user of this library only must be
     allowed to add messages, not procedures to print it.

   * target_comment/1 does not work, why? :-(.

****************************************

*Author(s):* Manuel Hermenegildo.

   This is a (temporary) extension to library `system' (which it
reexports). It implements functionality that is often convenient in `Makefile's.
Much of this should probably end up eventually in `system', but once
we have worked out the best interface and, in some cases, the proper
implementation (the implementations in here are in some cases just
calls to Un*x shell primitives or commands).

PART VII - Ciao extensions
**************************

*Author(s):* The CLIP Group.

   The libraries documented in this part extend the Ciao language in
several different ways. The extensions include:

   * pure Prolog programming (well, this can be viewed more as a
     restriction than an extension);

   * feature terms or _records_ (i.e., structures with names for each
     field);

   * parallel programming (e.g., &-Prolog style);

   * functional syntax;

   * higher-order;

   * global variables;

   * `setarg' and `undo';

   * delaying predicate execution;

   * active modules;

   * breadth-first execution;

   * iterative deepening-based execution;

   * constraint logic programming;

   * object oriented programming.

95 Pure Prolog package
**********************

*Author(s):* The CLIP Group.

   This library package allows the use of _pure Prolog_ in a Ciao
module/program. It is based on the fact that if an _engine module_ is
imported explicitly then all of them have to be imported explicitly.
The engine modules are:
   * `engine(arithmetic)'

     *note Arithmetic::.

   * `engine(atomic_basic)'

     *note Basic predicates handling names of constants::.

   * `engine(attributes)'

     *note Attributed variables::.

   * `engine(basic_props)'

     *note Basic data types and properties::.

   * `engine(basiccontrol)'

     *note Control constructs/predicates::.

   * `engine(data_facts)'

     *note Fast/concurrent update of facts::.

   * `engine(exceptions)'

     *note Exception and Signal handling::.

   * `engine(io_aux)'

     *note Message printing primitives::.

   * `engine(io_basic)'

     *note Basic input/output::.

   * `engine(prolog_flags)'

     *note Changing system behaviour and various flags::.

   * `engine(streams_basic)'

     *note Basic file/stream handling::.

   * `engine(system_info)'

     *note Gathering some basic internal info::.

   * `engine(term_basic)'

     *note Basic term manipulation::.

   * `engine(term_compare)'

     *note Comparing terms::.

   * `engine(term_typing)'

     *note Extra-logical properties for typing::.

   Note that if any of these modules is explicitely imported in a
program then the language defaults to Pure Prolog, plus the
functionality added by the modules explicitely imported.

   It is recommended that if you explicitely import an engine module
you also use this package, which will guarantee that the predicate
`true/0' is defined (note that this is the only Ciao builtin which
cannot be redefined).

96 Multiple Argument Indexing
*****************************

*Author(s):* Anil Nair (original work), Tom Howland
(`http://home.pacbell.net/tomjdnh/pd.html', derived the original
work), Francisco Bueno (port to Ciao).

   This package is an extension of the idea of Prolog indexing,
usually performed, in a limited way, on the first argument. This
package provides more powerful indexing schemes. It lets you pick
different arguments to index on, and provides for different
combinations of arguments to index on. E.g., it will let you index on
the first and third argument or the second and the third argument of
a predicate.

   The indexing is based on computing a hash value for the terms to
be indexed upon. Note, however, that the current implementation of
the package is done at the source level, so it may sometimes not be
as fast as expected. Given this, this version of the package pays off
only when the amount of clashing that your original predicate causes
without the package superseeds the cost of the hashing function in
the package. Such amount of course depends on the number and the form
of the facts in your predicate.

 -- PREDICATE: hash_term/2:
     `hash_term(Term,HashValue)'

     Provides an efficient way to calculate an integer `HashValue'
     for a ground `Term'.

     *Usage 1:* `hash_term(T,N)'
        - _Description:_ `N' is a hashing index for `T'.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `T' is currently ground (it contains no variables).
          (term_typing:ground/1)

96.3 Documentation on internals (`indexer_doc')
===============================================

 -- DECLARATION: index/1:
     *Usage:* :- `index(IndexSpecs)'.
        - _Description:_ Declares an indexing scheme for a predicate.
          All specs of `IndexSpecs' must be terms for the same
          predicate. Each spec declares an indexing on a combination
          of the arguments. Indexing will be performed using any of
          the specs in `IndexSpecs' (being thus interpreted as an or).

          You should use a `*' in an argument position if you wish to
          hash on the entire term in that argument. If a `+' is used
          only one level of the term in the argument is used for
          hashing. An `i' is used to indicate that argument is
          already an integer, and therefore its own value will be
          used for hashing. The argspec `?' simply indicates not to
          use the argument for indexing.

          For example, the index specification:
               :- index foo(+,?,*,i), foo(?,?,?,i).
          declares indexing for `foo/4' either on a combination of
          the first, third, and fourht arguments, or only on the last
          argument, which is an integer. In the first case, only the
          principal functor of the first argument will be used for
          hashing; the third argument will be used in its entirety.

          The argspec `n' is a pragmatic extension and can not be
          used in conjunction with the other specifiers aside from
          `?'. It stands for "nonvar" and implies that the argument
          will not be used for hashing, since only ground terms can
          effectively be used in hashing. Thus, it can not be used in
          combination with other specifiers within a particular index
          specification. It is often the fastest thing to use.

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `IndexSpecs' is an index specification.
          (indexer_doc:indexspecs/1)


 -- REGTYPE: indexspecs/1:
     An index specification is defined as follows:
          indexspecs(Spec) :-
                  indexspec(Spec).
          indexspecs((Spec,Specs)) :-
                  indexspec(Spec),
                  indexspecs(Specs).

          indexspec(Spec) :-
                  Spec=..[_F|Args],
                  list(Args,argspec).

     *Usage:* `indexspecs(IndexSpecs)'
        - _Description:_ `IndexSpecs' is an index specification.


 -- REGTYPE: argspec/1:
     An argument hash specification is defined as follows:
          argspec(+).
          argspec(*).
          argspec(i).
          argspec(n).
          argspec(?).

     *Usage:* `argspec(Spec)'
        - _Description:_ `Spec' is an argument hash specification.

99.2 Documentation on new declarations (`argnames_doc')
=======================================================

 -- DECLARATION: argnames/1:
     *Usage:* :- `argnames ArgNamedPredSpec'.
        - _Description:_ An `argnames/1' declaration assigns names to
          the argument positions of terms (or literal/goals) which
          use a certain functor/arity. This allows referring to these
          arguments by their name rather than by their argument
          position. Sometimes, argument names may be clearer and
          easier to remember than argument positions, specially for
          predicates with many arguments. Also, in some cases this
          may allow adding arguments to certain predicates without
          having to change the code that uses them. These terms with
          named arguments are sometimes also referred to as records,
          and are also similar to feature terms [AKPS92]. For
          example, in order to write a program for the _zebra_ puzzle
          we might declare:


               :- use_package([argnames]).
               :- argnames house(color, nation, pet, drink, car).

          which first includes the package and then assigns a name to
          each of the arguments of any term (or literal/goal) with
          `house/5' as the main functor.

          For convenience the package extends the built-in `data/1'
          declaration so that names to arguments can be asigned as
          with the `argnames/1' declaration, as for example:


               :- data product(id, description, brand, quantity).

          Once an `argnames/1' is given, it is possible to use the
          names to refer to the arguments of any term (or
          literal/goal) which has the same main functor as that of
          the term which appears in the `argnames/1' declaration.
          This is done by first writing the functor name, then the
          infix operator `$', and then, between curly brackets, zero,
          one, or more pairs _argument-name_`=>'_argument-value_,
          separated by commas (i.e., the infix operator `=>' is used
          between the name and the value). Again, argument names must
          be atomic. Argument values can be any term. Arguments which
          are not specified are assumed to have a value of "`_'"
          (i.e., they are left unconstrained).

          Thus, after the declaration for `house/5' in the example
          above, any ocurrence in that code of, for example,
          `house${nation=>Owns_zebra,pet=>zebra}' is exactly
          equivalent to `house(_,Owns_zebra,zebra,_,_)'. Also,
          `house${}' is equivalent to `house(_,_,_,_,_)'. The actual
          zebra puzzle specification might include a clause such as:


               zebra(Owns_zebra, Drinks_water, Street) :-
                  Street = [house${},house${},house${},house${},house${}],
                  member(house${nation=>Owns_zebra,pet=>zebra}, Street),
                  member(house${nation=>Drinks_water,drink=>water}, Street),
                  member(house${drink=>coffee,color=>green}, Street),
                  left_right(house${color=>ivory}, house${color=>green}, Street),
                  member(house${car=>porsche,pet=>snails}, Street),
                       ...

          Another syntax supported, useful mainly in declarations to
          avoid specifying the arity, is `house${/}', which is
          equivalent in our example to `house/5' (but for data
          declarations there is a special syntax as we have seen).

          Any number of `argnames/1' declarations can appear in a
          file, one for each functor whose arguments are to be
          accessed by name. As with other packages, argument name
          declarations are _local to the file_ in which they appear.
          The `argnames/1' declarations affect only program text
          which appears after the declaration. It is easy to make a
          set of declarations affect several files for example by
          putting such declarations in a sepatate file which is
          included by all such files.

          An `argnames/1' declaration does not change in any way the
          internal representation of the associated terms and does
          not affect run-time efficiency. It is simply syntactic
          sugar.

          *Runtime support*

          It is possible to write pairs with unbound argument names.
          In that case, runtime information is emitted to resolve the
          argument name at execution time.

99.3 Documentation on exports (`argnames_doc')
==============================================

 -- PREDICATE: $~/3:
     *Usage:* `$~(Term,Replacement,NewTerm)'
        - _Description:_ `NewTerm' is as `Term' but with the
          arguments specified in `Replacement' changed (they need to
          be in argnames syntax). The predicate is in fact virtual,
          since it is translated by the package to a pair of
          unifications. For example, given the declaration `:-
          argnames house(color, nation, pet, drink, car)', the goal
                  $~(House, house${car => seat, pet => mouse}, NewHouse)
          would be compiled to the unifications
                  House = house(C,N,_,D,_), NewHouse = house(C,N,mouse,D,seat).

100 Functional notation
***********************

*Author(s):* Daniel Cabeza, Amadeo Casas, Manuel Hermenegildo, Jose
F. Morales.

   This library package allows the use of functional notation in a
Ciao module/program. It supports function application, predefined
evaluable functors, functional definitions, quoting, and (combined
with the `lazy' library) lazy evaluation. The extensions implemented
by this library are also composable with higher-order features and
can be combined with other Ciao packages such as constraints,
assertions, etc.

   The package provides _syntactic sugar_ for defining and using
predicates as if they were functions. However, they can still retain
the power of predicates. Any function definition written using this
package is in fact defining a predicate, and any predicate can be
used as a function.

   The predicate associated with a function has the same name and one
more argument, meant as the place holder for the "result" of the
function. In fact, this argument is just the one that will be
syntactically connected to the surrounding goal or function, but it
does not necessarily imply any directionality, i.e., it does not
necessarily mean that this argument is an output or an input. This
argument is by default added to the right, i.e., it is the last
argument, but can be changed by using a declaration, as explained
below.

100.1 Function applications
===========================

Any term preceded by the `~ /1' operator is a function application,
as can be seen in the goal `write(~arg(1,T))', which is strictly
equivalent to the sequence `arg(1,T,A), write(A)'. The declaration `fun_return/1'
allows using a predicate argument other than the last as the return
argument. For example with `:- fun_return functor(~,_,_)' the
expression `~functor(f,2)' will be evaluated to the term `f(_,_)'.
This definition of the return argument can also be done on the fly in
each invocation in the following way: `~functor(~,f,2)'.

   Functors can be declared as evaluable by using the declaration `fun_eval/1'.
This allows avoiding the need to use the `~' operator. Thus, `:-
fun_eval arg/2' allows writing `write(arg(1,T))' instead of
`write(~arg(1,T))' as above. This declaration can be combined with
the previous one: `:- fun_eval functor(~,_,_)'.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Predefined evaluable functors,  Next: Functional definitions,  Prev: Function applications,  Up: Functional notation

100.2 Predefined evaluable functors
===================================

By using the declaration `:- fun_eval arith(true)', all the functors
understood by `is/2' will be also evaluated. This is active from the
declaration downwards until a `:- fun_eval arith(false)' declaration
or the end of the module is reached. Beware that arithmetic functors
are used in some cases for other purposes than arithmetic: e.g.
`abolish(p/2)'. But this is not so disturbing as it may appear
because this package is not active in declarations, except for the
goal-including declarations `initialization/1' and `on_abort/1'. Note
that all the declarations introduced by this package, as is customary
in Ciao, are local to the module where they are included.

   In addition to functors declared with the declaration `fun_eval/1',
the package defines as evaluable the functors used for disjunctive
and conditional expressions: `| /2' and `? /2' (defined as
operators). A disjunctive expression has the form `(V1|V2)', and its
value when first evaluated is `V1', and on backtracking `V2'. A
conditional expression has the form `(Cond ? V1)', or more commonly
`(Cond ? V1 | V2)', and its value, if the execution of `Cond' as a
goal succeeds, is `V1', otherwise in the first form it causes
backtracking, and on the second form its value is `V2'. Note that due
to the operator precedences, these expressions normally need to be
surrounded by parenthesis. Also, a nested expression: `(Cond1 ? V1 |
Cond2 ? V2 | V3)' is evaluated as `(Cond1 ? V1 | (Cond2 ? V2 | V3))'.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Functional definitions,  Next: Quoting functors,  Prev: Predefined evaluable functors,  Up: Functional notation

100.3 Functional definitions
============================

A functional definition is composed of one or more functional
clauses. A functional clause is written using the binary operator `:=
/2', as in:
     opposite(red) := green.
   which is equivalent to `opposite(red,green).' or
     addlast(X,L) := ~append(L,[X]).
   which is equivalent to `addlast(X,L,R) :- append(L,[X],R).'

   Functional clauses can also have a body, which is executed before
the result value is computed. It can serve as a guard for the clause
or to provide the equivalent of where-clauses in functional languages:
     fact(0) := 1.
     fact(N) := N * ~fact(--N) :- N > 0.
   Note that guards can often be defined more compactly using
conditional expressions:
     fact(N) := N = 0 ? 1
              | N > 0 ? N * ~fact(--N).
   The declaration `:- fun_eval defined(true)' allows to locally
define as evaluable functions being defined, so that the `~' operator
does not need to be used within a functional definition for the
functor being defined. For example, for the `fact' invocations in the
previous definitions, which can now be written as, e.g. (we provide
the full module definition):
     :- module(_,_,[fsyntax]).

     :- fun_eval arith(true).
     :- fun_eval defined(true).

     fact(0) := 1.
     fact(N) := N * fact(--N) :- N > 0.

     %% Or,alternatively:
     %
     % fact(N) := N=0 ? 1
     %          | N>0 ? N * fact(--N).

This behaviour is reverted using `:- fun_eval defined(false)'.

   The translation of functional clauses has the following properties:
   * The translation produces _steadfast_ predicates, that is, output
     arguments are unified after possible cuts.

   * Defining recursive predicates in functional style maintains the
     tail recursion of the original predicate, thus allowing the
     usual compiler optimizations.

   Some implementation details and a discussion of the recent
combination of this library (which dates from Ciao version 0.2) with
the lazy evaluation library can be found in [CCH06].

100.4 Quoting functors
======================

Functors (either in functional or predicate clauses) can be prevented
from being evaluated by using the `^ /1' prefix operator (read as
"quote"), as in
     :- fun_eval arith(true).
     pair(A,B) := ^(A-B).
   Note that this just prevents the evaluation of the principal
functor of the enclosed term, not the possible occurrences of other
evaluable functors inside.

100.5 Some scoping issues
=========================

When using function applications inside the goal arguments of
meta-predicates, there is an ambiguity as they could be evaluated
either in the scope of the outer execution or the in the scope of the
inner execution. The chosen behavior is by default to evaluate
function applications in the scope of the outer execution. If they
should be evaluated in the inner scope, the goal containing the
function application needs to be escaped with the `^^ /1' prefix
operator, as in `findall(X, (d(Y), ^^(X = ~f(Y)+1)), L)' (which could
also be written as `findall(X, ^^ (d(Y), X = ~f(Y)+1), L)') and which
expands into `findall(X, (d(Y),f(Y,Z),T is Z+1,X=T), L)'. With no
escaping the function application is evaluated in the scope of the
outer execution, i.e., it expands to `f(Y,Z), T is Z+1, findall(X,
(d(Y),X=T), L)'.

100.6 Other functionality
=========================

In addition to the basic package `fsyntax', a package `functional' is
also provided, to allow programming with a more functional-flavored
style. That package activates the declarations `:- fun_eval
arith(true)' and `:- fun_eval defined(true)', and defines the `. /2'
operator for use in lists (but be careful: this period cannot be
followed by a whitespace!) and the operator `++ /2' as a function for
appending lists. The factorial example above can be written as
follows using the `functional' package:
     :- module(_,_,[fsyntax]).

     :- fun_eval arith(true).
     :- fun_eval defined(true).

     fact(0) := 1.
     fact(N) := N * fact(--N) :- N > 0.

     %% Or,alternatively:
     %
     % fact(N) := N=0 ? 1
     %          | N>0 ? N * fact(--N).

   See the end of this chapter for additional examples.

100.7 Combining with higher order
=================================

Ciao provides in its standard library the `hiord' package, which
supports a form of higher-order untyped logic programming with
predicate abstractions [CH99a,Cab04,CHL04]. Predicate abstractions
are Ciao's translation to logic programming of the lambda expressions
of functional programming: they define unnamed predicates which will
be ultimately executed by a higher-order call, unifying its arguments
appropriately. A function abstraction is provided as functional
syntactic sugar for predicate abstractions:

   Predicate abstraction: `''(X,Y) :- p(X,Z), q(Z,Y)'.

   Function abstraction: `''(X) := ~q(~p(X))'.

and function application is syntactic sugar over predicate
application:

   Predicate application: `..., P(X,Y), ...' Function application:
`..., Y = ~P(X), ...'

   The combination of this `hiord' package with the `fsyntax' and
`lazy' packages (and, optionally, the type inference and checking
provided by the Ciao preprocessor [HPBLG05]) basically provide the
functionality present in modern functional languages (currying is not
_syntactically_ implemented, but its results can be obtained by
deriving higher-order data from any other higher-order data (see
[Cab04]), as well as some of the functionality of full higher-order
logic programming.

   At this moment, it is necessary to specify the `:- fun_eval
hiord(true)' option to enable correct handling of function
abstractions.

100.10 Some examples using functional syntax
============================================

We now illustrate some of the uses of the package through examples.
The following example defines a simple unary function `der(X)' which
returns the derivative of a polynomial arithmetic expression:

     der(x)      := 1.
     der(C)      := 0                 :- number(C).
     der(A + B)  := der(A) + der(B).
     der(C * A)  := C * der(A)        :- number(C).
     der(x ** N) := N * x ** ~(N - 1) :- integer(N), N > 0.

   Note that if we include the directive mentioned before which makes
arithmetic functors evaluable then we would have to write the program
in the following (clearly, less pleasant and more obfuscated) way:

     :- fun_eval(arith(true)).
     der(x)         := 1.
     der(C)         := 0                      :- number(C).
     der(^(A + B))  := ^(der(A) + der(B)).
     der(^(C * A))  := ^(C * der(A))          :- number(C).
     der(^(x ** N)) := ^(N * ^(x ** (N - 1))) :- integer(N), N > 0.

   Both of the previous code fragments translate to the following
code:

     der(x, 1).
     der(C, 0) :-
               number(C).
     der(A + B, X + Y) :-
               der(A, X),
               der(B, Y).
     der(C * A, C * X) :-
               number(C),
               der(A, X).
     der(x ** N, N * x ** N1) :-
               integer(N),
               N > 0,
               N1 is N - 1.

   Functional notation interacts well with other Ciao language
features. For example, it provides compact and familiar notation for
regular types and other properties:

     :- module(_,_,[hiord,functional,assertions,regtypes,'bf/bfall']).

     :- regtype color/1. color := red | blue | green.

     :- regtype slist/1. slist := [] | [ _ | slist].

     :- regtype list_of/1. list_of(T) := [] | [~T | list_of(T)].

where the functional clauses expand to (note the use of higher-order
in the third example):

     color(red). color(blue). color(green).
     list([]).
     list([_|T]) :- list(T).
     list_of(_, []).
     list_of(T, [X|Xs]) :- T(X), list_of(T, Xs).

Such types and properties are then admissible in the usual way in
assertions, e.g.:

     :- pred append/3 :: list * list * list.
     :- pred color_value/2 :: list(color) * int.

   The combination of functional syntax and user-defined operators
brings significant flexibility, as can be seen in the following
definition of a list concatenation (`append') operator (note that
these are the definitions mentioned before which are active by
default in the `functional' package):

     :- op(600, xfy, (.)).
     :- op(650, xfy, (++)).
     :- fun_eval (++)/2.
     []   ++ L := L.
     X.Xs ++ L := X.(Xs ++ L).

This definition will be compiled exactly to the standard definition
of `append' (and, thus, will be reversible). The functional syntax
and user-defined operators allow writing for example `Space = ' ',
write("Hello" ++ Space ++ "world!")' instead of the equivalent forms
`Space = ' ', write( append("Hello", append(Space, "world!")))' (if
`append/2' is defined as evaluable) or `Space = ' ', append(Space,
"world!", T1),' `append("Hello", T1, T2),' `write(T2)'.

   As another example, we can define an array indexing operator for
fixed-size, multi-dimensional arrays. Assume that arrays are built
using nested structures whose main functor is `a' and whose arities
are determined by the specified dimensions, i.e., a two-dimensional
array _A_ of dimensions _[N,M]_ will be represented by the nested
structure `a(a(_A11_,...,_A1M_), a(_A21_,..,_A2M_), ...,
a(_AN1_,...,' `_ANM_))', where `_A11_,... _ANM_' may be arbitrary
terms (we ignore for simplicity arity limitations, solved in any case
typically by further nesting with logarithmic access time). The
following recursive definition defines the property `fixed_array/2'
and also the array access operator `@':

     fixed_array([N|Ms],A):-
     	functor(A,a,N),
     	rows(N,Ms,A).
     fixed_array([N],A):-
     	functor(A,a,N).

     rows(0,_,_).
     rows(N,Ms,A) :-
             N > 0,
             arg(N,A,Arg),
             array(Ms,Arg),
             rows(N-1,Ms,A).

     :- pred @(Array,Index,Elem) :: array * list(int) * int
        # "@var{Elem} is the @var{Index}-th element of @var{Array}.".

     :- op(55, xfx, '@').
     :- fun_eval (@)/2.
     V@[I]    := ~arg(I,V).       %% Or: V@[] := V.
     V@[I|Js] := ~arg(I,V)@Js.

   This allows writing, e.g., `M = fixed_array([2,2]), M@[2,1] = 3'
(which could also be expressed as `fixed_array([2,2])@[2,1] = 3'),
where the call to the `fixed_array' property generates an empty _2 x
2_ array _M_ and `M@[2,1] = 3' puts _3_ in _M[2,1]_. This can be done
in the top level:
     ?- M = ~fixed_array([2,2]), M@[2,1] = 3.
   provided the `op' and `function' declarations are loaded into the
top level also. Another example of use is: `A3@[N+1,M] = A1@[N-1,M] +
A2@[N,M+2]'.

   Such functionality can be grouped into a _package_ as follows. The
package main file (`arrays.pl') might be:
     :- package(arrays).
     :- include(arrays_ops).

     :- use_module(arrays_rt).
   where file `arrays_ops.pl' may contain:
     :- use_package(functional).

     :- op(150,xfx,[@]).
     :- fun_eval '@'/2.

     :- op(500,yfx,<+>).
     :- fun_eval '<+>'/2.

     :- op(400,yfx,<*>).
     :- fun_eval '<*>'/2.
   The main file is `arrays_rt.pl' which would contain for example
(note that it also uses `arrays_ops.pl', and that is why the contents
of `arrays_ops.pl' were not put directly in `arrays.pl'):
     :- module(arrays_rt,_,[functional,hiord,assertions,regtypes,isomodes]).

     :- include(arrays_ops).

100.11 Examples of combining with higher order
==============================================

The following `map' and `foldl' definitions (from the `hiordlib'
library) illustrate the combination of functional syntax and
higher-order logic programming:
     :- fun_eval map/2.
     :- meta_predicate map(_,pred(2),_).
     map([], _)     := [].
     map([X|Xs], P) := [P(X) | map(Xs, P)].

     :- fun_eval foldl/3.
     :- meta_predicate foldl(_,_,pred(3),_).
     foldl([], Seed, _Op) := Seed.
     foldl([X|Xs], Seed, Op) := ~Op(X,~foldl(Xs,Seed,Op)).

   With this definition:
     ?- L = ~map([1,2,3], ( _(X,Y):- Y = f(X) ) ).

     L = [f(1),f(2),f(3)] ?

     ?- [f(1),f(2),f(3)] = ~map(L, ( _(X,f(X)) :- true ) ).

     L = [1,2,3] ?

   Also, after running:
     ?- ["helloworld", "byeworld"] = map(["hello", "bye"], ++(X)).

(where `(++)/2' corresponds to the above definition of `append') `X'
will be bound to `"world"', which is the only solution to the
equation.

   And when calling:
     map(L, ++(X), ["hello.", "bye."]).

several values for `L' and `X' are returned through backtracking:

     L = ["hello","bye"],   X = "." ? ;
     L = ["hello.","bye."], X = [] ?

(remember to set the flag `write_strings' to on in these examples so
that the top level prints strings as strings of characters instead of
lists of ASCII codes).

=======================================================

A definition of the Fibonacci function, written in functional
notation:

     :- module(_,_,[functional]).

     fib(0) := 0.
     fib(1) := 1.
     fib(N) := fib(N-1) + fib(N-2) :- integer(N), N > 1.

     write_fib(N):-
             message(['The ',N,'. Fibonacci number is: ',~fib(N),'.']).

   This is the factorial example, written in functional notation and
including some assertions:

     :- module(_,_,[assertions,nativeprops,functional]).

     :- pred fact(+int,-int) + is_det.
     :- pred fact(-int,+int) + non_det.

     fact(N) := N=0 ? 1
              | N>0 ? N * fact(--N).

   And, the same example written using `clpq' constraints:
     :- module(_,_,[assertions,nativeprops,fsyntax,clpqf]).

     :- fun_eval .=. /1.
     :- op(700,fx,[.=.]).
     :- fun_eval fact/1.

     :- pred fact(+int,-int) + is_det.
     :- pred fact(-int,-int) + non_det.

     fact( .=. 0) := .=. 1.
     fact(N) := .=. N*fact( .=. N-1 ) :- N .>. 0.
   which allows for example calling it "backwards:"
     ?- 24 = ~fact(X).

     X = 4 ?

   A very simple example using lazy evaluation:

     :- module(_,_,[functional,lazy]).
     :- use_module(library(lazy(lazy_lib)), [take/3]).

     nums(N) := ~take(N,nums_from(0)).

     :- lazy fun_eval nums_from/1.

     nums_from(X) := [X | nums_from(X+1)].

   A naive reverse example, using functional notation:

     :- module(_, [nrev/2], [functional]).

     nrev( [] )    := [].
     nrev( [H|T] ) := ~conc( nrev(T),[H] ).

     conc( [],    L ) := L.
     conc( [H|T], K ) := [ H | conc(T,K) ].

   And the same example using some assertions:

     :- module(_, [nrev/2], [assertions,fsyntax,nativeprops]).

     :- entry nrev/2 : {list, ground} * var.

     :- pred nrev(A,B) : list(A) => list(B)
        + ( not_fails, is_det, steps_o( exp(length(A),2) ) ).

     nrev( [] )    := [].
     nrev( [H|L] ) := ~conc( ~nrev(L),[H] ).


     :- pred conc(A,_,_) + ( terminates, is_det, steps_o(length(A)) ).

     conc( [],    L ) := L.
     conc( [H|L], K ) := [ H | ~conc(L,K) ].

   Finally, a simple stream creation example where assertions are
used to define a safety policy (that no file outside `/tmp' should be
opened):

     :- module(_,[create_streams/2],[fsyntax,assertions,regtypes]).

     :- entry create_streams(A,B) : list(A,num).

     create_streams([])     := [].
     create_streams([N|NL]) := [ ~open_file(Fname,write) | ~create_streams(NL) ]
             :-
              app("/tmp/../",~number_codes(N),Fname).
     %        app("/tmp/",~number_codes(N),Fname).

     app([],L) := L.
     app([X|Xs],L) := [X|~app(Xs,L)].

     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     % open_file library:

     open_file(Fname,Mode) := ~open(File,Mode) :- atom_codes(File,Fname).

     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     % Safety policy:

     :- check calls open_file(Fname,_,_) : safe_name(Fname).

     :- regtype  safe_name/1.    safe_name("/tmp/" || L) :- list(L,alphnum_code).

     :- regtype  alphnum_code/1. alphnum_code := ~alph_code | ~num_code.

     :- regtype  alph_code/1.    alph_code := 0'a | 0'b | 0'c | 0'd | 0'e | 0'f .

102 Andorra execution
*********************

*Author(s):* Claudio Vaucheret, Francisco Bueno.

   This package allows the execution under the Basic Andorra Model
[War88]. The model classifies goals as a _determinate goal_, if at
most one clause matches the goal, or nondeterminate goal, otherwise.
In this model a goal is delayed until either it becomes determinate
or it becomes the leftmost goal and no determinate goal is available.
The implementation of this selection rule is based on the use of
attributed variables [Hol92,Hol90].

   In order to test determinacy we verify only the heads of clauses
and builtins in the bodies of clauses before the first cut, if any.
By default, determinacy of a goal is detected dynamically: when
called, if at most one clause matches, it is executed; otherwise, it
is delayed. For goals delayed the test is repeated each time a
variable appearing in the goal is instantiated. In addition,
efficiency can be improved by using declarations that specify the
determinacy conditions. These will be considered for testing instead
of the generic test on all clauses that can match.

   As with any other Ciao package, the andorra computation rule
affects only the module that uses the package. If execution passes
across two modules that use the computation rule, determinate goals
are run in advance _within_ one module and also within the other
module. But determinate goals of one module do not run ahead of goals
of the other module.

   It is however possible to preserve the computation rule for calls
to predicates defined in other modules. These modules should
obviously also use this package. In addition _all_ predicates from
such modules should imported, i.e., the directive `:-
use_module(module)', should be used in this case instead of `:-
use_module(module,[...])'. Otherwise calls to predicates outside the
module will only be called when they became the leftmost goal.

=======================================================

 -- DECLARATION: determinate/2:
     :- `determinate(Pred,Cond)'.

     Declares determinacy conditions for a predicate. Conditions
     `Cond' are on variables of arguments of `Pred'. For example, in:
          :- determinate(member(A,B,C), ( A ?= term(B,[1])  ; C?=[_|_]) ).

          member(A,[A|B],B).
          member(A,[B|C],[B|D]) :-
                  A==B,
                  member(A,C,D).
     the declaration states that a call `member(A,B,C)' is
     determinate when either `A' doesn't unify with the first
     argument of `B' or `C' doesn't unify with `[_|_]'.

     *Usage:* :- `determinate(Pred,Cond)'.
        - _Description:_ States that the predicate `Pred' is
          determinate when `Cond' holds.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Pred' is a Name/Arity structure denoting a predicate name:
               predname(P/A) :-
                       atm(P),
                       nnegint(A).

          (basic_props:predname/1)

          `Cond' is a determinacy condition.

                  var(X).
          detcond(instatiated(A,Path)) :-

                  path(Term2).
          detcond(Test) :-
                  ( test Test ).

        * `ground/1' and `nonvar/1' have the usual meaning.

        * `instatiated(A,Path)' means that the subterm of `A'
          addressed by `Path' is not a variable. `Path' is a list of
          integer numbers describing a path to the subterm regarding
          the whole term A as a tree. For example,
          `instantiated(f(g(X),h(i(Z),Y)),[2,1])' tests whether
          `i(Z)' is not a variable.

        * `Term1 ?\= Term2' means "terms `Term1' and `Term2' do not
          unify (when instantiated)". `Term1' and `Term2' can be
          either an argument of the predicate or a term
          `term(V,Path)', which refers to the subterm of `V'
          addressed by `Path'.

        * `Term1 ?= Term2' means "terms `Term1' and `Term2' unify
          (when instantiated)". The same considerations above apply
          to `Term1' and `Term2'.

        * any other test that does not unify variables can also be
          used ( `==/2', `\==/2', `atomic/1').

     *Usage:* `detcond(X)'
        - _Description:_ `X' is a determinacy condition.


 -- REGTYPE: path/1:
     Defined by:
          path(X) :-
                  var(X).

104 Low-level concurrency primitives for and-parallelism support
****************************************************************

*Author(s):* Amadeo Casas (`http://www.cs.unm.edu/~amadeo',
University of New Mexico).

   This module provides basic mechanisms to start threads, wait for
their completion, push goals, search for goals, access to locks, etc.
Most of these primitives need to refer to an explicit goal and need
to use some information related to its state, stored in the data
structure `Handler'.

   This primitives allow to efficiently implement at a higher-level
different approaches to exploiting independent and-parallelism.

105 Call on determinate
***********************

*Author(s):* Jose F. Morales, Manuel Carro.

   Offers an enriched variant of call and cut `!!/0' which executes
pending goals when the computation has no more alternatives.

   This library is useful to, for example, get rid of external
connections once the necessary data has been obtained.

*****************

*Author(s):* Re'my Haemmerle'.

   *Version:* 2.0 (2010/8/9)

   This module provides mutable terms i.e. an abstract datatype
provides with efficient backtrackable destructive assignment. In
other words, any destructive assignments are transparently undone on
backtracking. Modifications that are intended to survive backtracking
must be done by asserting or retracting dynamic program clauses
instead. Mutable must be prefered to destructive assignment of
arbitrary terms using `setarg/3' of the module  which does not have
safe semantics.

 -- DECLARATION: block/1:
     *Usage:* :- `block(BlockSpecs)'.
        - _Description:_ In this declaration `BlockSpecs' specifies a
          disjunction of conditions. Each condition is of the form
          `predname(C1, ..., CN)' where each `CI' is either a ``-''
          if the call must suspend until the corresponding argument
          is bound, or anything else otherwise.

        - _Convention:_ The recommended style is to write the block
          declarations in front of the source code of the predicate
          they refer to. Indeed, they are part of the source code of
          the predicate and must precede the first clause. Moreover
          it is suggested to use ``?'' for specifying non conditioned
          arguments.

        - _Example :_ The following definition calls to `merge/3'
          having uninstantiated arguments in the first and third
          position or in the second and third position will suspend.

               :- block merge(-,?,-), merge(?,-,-).

111 Delaying predicates (when)
******************************

*Author(s):* Manuel Carro.

   `when/2' delays a predicate until some condition in its variable
is met. For example, we may want to find out the maximum of two
numbers, but we are not sure when they will be instantiated. We can
write the standard `max/3' predicate (but changing its name to `gmax/3'
to denote that the first and second arguments must be ground) as

     gmax(X, Y, X):- X > Y, !.
     gmax(X, Y, Y):- X =< Y.

   and then define a 'safe' `max/3' as

     max(X, Y, Z):-
             when((ground(X),ground(Y)), gmax(X, Y, Z)).

   which can be called as follows:

     ?- max(X, Y, Z) , Y = 0, X = 8.

     X = 8,
     Y = 0,
     Z = 8 ?

     yes

   Alternatively, `max/3' could have been defined as

     max(X, Y, Z):-
             when(ground((X, Y)), gmax(X, Y, Z)).

   with the same effects as above. More complex implementations are
possible. Look, for example, at the `max.pl' implementation under the
`when' library directory, where a `max/3' predicate is implemented
which waits on all the arguments until there is enough information to
determine their values:

     ?- use_module(library(when(max))).

     yes
     ?- max(X, Y, Z), Z = 5, Y = 4.

     X = 5,
     Y = 4,
     Z = 5 ?

     yes

          penalty in the condition checking.

112 Active modules (high-level distributed execution)
*****************************************************

*Author(s):* Manuel Hermenegildo, Daniel Cabeza.

   Active modules [CH95] provide a high-level model of inter-process
communication and distributed execution (note that this is also
possible using Ciao's communication and concurrency primitives, such
as sockets, concurrent predicates, etc., but at a lower level of
abstraction). An _active module_ (or an _active object_) is an
ordinary module to which computational resources are attached, and
which resides at a given location on the network. Compiling an active
module produces an executable which, when running, acts as a _server_
for a number of predicates: the predicates exported by the module.
Predicates exported by an active module can be accessed by a program
on the network by simply "using" the module, which then imports such
"remote predicates." The process of "using" an active module does not
involve transferring any code, but rather setting up things so that
calls in the module using the active module are executed as remote
procedure calls to the active module. This occurs in the same way
independently of whether the active module and the using module are
in the same machine or in different machines across the network.

   Except for having to compile it in a special way (see below), an
active module is identical from the programmer point of view to an
ordinary module. A program using an active module imports it and uses
it in the same way as any other module, except that it uses " `use_active_module'"
rather than " `use_module'" (see below). Also, an active module has
an address (network address) which must be known in order to use it.
In order to use an active module it is necessary to know its address:
different "protocols" are provided for this purpose (see below). (1)

   From the implementation point of view, active modules are
essentially daemons: executables which are started as independent
processes at the operating system level. Communication with active
modules is implemented using sockets (thus, the address of an active
module is an IP socket address in a particular machine). Requests to
execute goals in the module are sent through the socket by remote
programs. When such a request arrives, the process running the active
module takes it and executes it, returning through the socket the
computed answers. These results are then taken and used by the remote
processes. Backtracking over such remote calls works as usual and
transparently. The only limitation (this may change in the future,
but it is currently done for efficiency reasons) is that all
alternative answers are precomputed (and cached) upon the first call
to an active module and thus _an active module should not export a
predicate which has an infinite number of answers_.

   The first thing to do is to select a method whereby the client(s)
(the module(s) that will use the active module) can find out in which
machine/port (IP address/socket number) the server (i.e., the active
module) will be listening once started, i.e., a "protocol" to
communicate with the active module. The easiest way to do this is to
make use of the rendezvous methods which are provided in the Ciao
distribution in the `library/actmods' directory; currently,
`tmpbased...', `filebased...', `webbased...', and `platformbased...'.

   The first one is based on saving the IP address and socket number
of the server in a file in a predefined directory (generally `/tmp',
but this can be changed by changing `tmpbased_common.pl').

   The second one is similar but saves the info in the directory in
which the server is started (as _<module_name>_`.addr'), or in the
directory that a `.addr' file, if it exists, specifies. The clients
must be started in the same directory (or have access to a file
`.addr' specifying the same directory). However, they can be started
in different machines, provided this directory is shared (e.g., by
NFS or Samba), or the file can be moved to an appropriate directory
on a different machine -provided the full path is the same.

   The third one is based on a name server for active modules. When
an active module is started, it communicates its address to the name
server. When the client of the active module wants to communicate
with it, it asks the name server the active module address. This is
all done transparently to the user. The name server must be running
when the active module is started (and, of course, when the
application using it is executed). The location of the name server
for an application must be specified in an application file named
`webbased_common.pl' (see Section 3.1 below).

   The fourth one is also based on a name server, but the address of
the name server is given as a parameter to the active modules when
started.

   The rendezvous methods (or protocols) are encoded in two modules:
a first one, called `...publish.pl', is used by the server to publish
its info. The second one, called `...locate.pl', is used by the
client(s) to locate the server info. For efficiency, the client
methods maintain a cache of addresses, so that the server information
only needs to be read from the file system the first time the active
module is accessed.

   Active modules are compiled using the `-a' option of the Ciao
compiler (this can also be done from the interactive top-level shell
using `make_actmod/2'). For example, issuing the following command:

       ciaoc -a 'actmods/filebased_publish' simple_server

   compiles the simple server example that comes with the
distribution (in the `actmods/example' directory). The
`simple_client_with_main' example (in the same directory) can be
compiled as usual:

       ciaoc simple_client_with_main

   Note that the client uses the `actmods' package, specifies the
rendezvous method by importing `library(actmods(filebased_locate))',
and explicitely imports the "remote" predicates (_implicit imports
will not work_). Each module using the `actmods' package _should only
use one of the rendezvous methods_.

   Now, if the server is running (e.g., `simple_server &' in Un*x or
double-clicking on it in Win32) when the client is executed it will
connect with the server to access the predicate(s) that it imports
from it.

   A simpler even client `simple_client.pl' can be loaded into the
top level and its predicates called as usual (and they will connect
with the server if it is running).

   (1) It is also possible to provide active modules via a WWW
address. However, we find it more straightforward to simply use
socket addresses. In any case, this is generally hidden inside the
access method and can be thus made transparent to the user.

=======================================

The protocols `webbased' and `platformbased' are described in this
section with a bit more detail.

112.5 Active module name servers (webbased protocol)
====================================================

An application using a name server for active modules must have a
file named `webbased_common.pl' that specifies where the name server
resides. It must have the `URL' and the path which corresponds to
that `URL' in the file system of the server machine (the one that
hosts the `URL') of the file that will hold the name server address.

   The current distribution provides a file `webbased_common.pl' that
can be used (after proper setting of its contents) for a server of
active modules for a whole installation. Alternatively, particular
servers for each application can be set up (see below).

   The current distribution also provides a module that can be used
as name server by any application. It is in file `examples/webbased_server/webbased_server.pl'.

   To set up a name server edit `webbased_common.pl' to change its
contents appropriately as described above (`URL' and corresponding
complete file path). Then recompile this library module:
         ciaoc -c webbased_common
   The name server has to be compiled as an active module itself:
         ciaoc -a actmods/webserver_publish webbased_server
   It has to be started in the server machine before the application
and its active modules are compiled.

   Alternatively, you can copy `webbased_common.pl' and use it to set
up name servers for particular applications. Currently, this is a bit
complicated. You have to ensure that the name server, the application
program, and all its active modules are compiled and executed with
the same `webbased_common.pl' module. One way to do this is to create
a subdirectory `actmods' under the directory of your application,
copy `webbased_common.pl' to it, modify it, and then compile the name
server, the application program, and its active modules using a
library path that guarantees that your `actmods' directory is located
by the compiler before the standard Ciao library. The same applies
for when running all of them if the library loading is dynamic.

   One way to do the above is using the `-u' compiler option. Assume
the following file:
          :- module(paths,[],[]).
          :- multifile library_directory/1.
          :- dynamic library_directory/1.
          :- initialization(asserta_fact(
     	library_directory('/root/path/to/my/particular/application') )).
   then you have file `webbased_common.pl' in a subdirectory
`actmods' of the above cited path. You have to compile the name
server, the active modules, and the rest of the application with:
         ciaoc -u paths -s ...
   to use your particular `webbased_common.pl' and to make
executables statically link libraries. If they are dynamic, then you
have to provide for the above library_directory path to be set up
upon execution. This can be done, for example, by including module
`paths' into your executables.

   Addresses of active modules are saved by the name server in a
subdirectory `webbased_db' of the directory where you start it --see
`examples/webbased_server/webbased_db/webbased_server'). This allows
to restart the server right away if it dies (since it saves its
state). This directory should be cleaned up regularly of addresses of
active modules which are no more active. To do this, stop the server
--by killing it (its pid is in `PATH/FILE'), and restart it after
cleaning up the files in the above mentioned directory.

112.6 Platforms (platformbased protocol)
========================================

This protocol is also based on a name server. There are, however, two
differences with the above one: the name server address and the
active modules names are dynamic. On the one hand, the name server
address (IP address/socket number) is given to the active modules
when they are started up. This might be convenient when using the
same name server executable for different applications starting up a
different name server process for each application. On the other
hand, the name assigned to a given active module can also be given as
a parameter to the active module when it is started up. This makes it
easier to maintain a local name space for particular applications
(e.g., two modules with the same name can be used as active modules
in the same application).

   The code of a name server for the previous section protocol can
also be used for this protocol (e.g., file `examples/webbased_server/webbased_server.pl').

112.7 Known bugs and planned improvements (`actmods_doc')
=========================================================

   * The package provides no means for security: the accessing
     application must take care of this (?).

   * It can happen that there is a unique process for an active
     module serving calls from several different simultaneous
     executions of the same application (or even different
     applications). In this case, there might be unwanted
     interactions (e.g., if the active module has state).

   * Applications may fail if the name server or an active module is
     restarted during execution of the application (since they might
     restart at a different port than the one cached by the
     application).

   * One may want name servers to reside at a fixed and known machine
     and port number (this is known as a _service_ and is defined in
     `/etc/services' in a Un*x machine).

113 Agents
**********

*Author(s):* Francisco Bueno.

   An agent is an active module which has a main execution thread.
Simultaneously (i.e., in concurrent execution with the main thread),
the agent receives messages from other agents, which trigger the
execution of a predicate by the name of the message. Messages can
also be sent to other agents, by calling the predicate by the name of
the message in the context of the receiver agent (see `::/2' below).
Agents are identified by name. The name of an agent is usually the
name of its (main) file, but this depends on the protocol used (see
`protocol/1' below).

   A simple agent that sends inform messages and at the same time
receives them from other agents, answering back ok, will look like:
     :- agent(simple,[inform/2,ok/1]).
     :- protocol('actmods/filebased').

     agent :-
         repeat,
         display('Agent id:message?- '), read(Agent:Mess),
         Agent::inform(Mess),
         fail.

     inform(Agent,Mess):-
         display(Agent), display(' has sent: ', display(Mess), nl,
         Agent::ok.

     ok(_Agent).

=====================================================

 -- DECLARATION: protocol/1:
     A protocol is formed by a pair of modules which allow to locate
     connection addresses of agents. By convention, the names of
     these modules have a common prefix, which makes reference to the
     protocol, and have suffixes '_locate' and '_publish'. The
     'publish' part of the protocol must define a multifile predicate `save_addr_actmod/1'
     and the 'locate' part export a predicate `module_address/2'. The
     first one publishes an agent address; the second one locates the
     address of an agent. Together, both make it possible for agents
     to send and receive messages. All agents in a multi-agent system
     must therefore use the same protocol. Upon compilation, they
     will then be (automatically) instrumented as active modules
     under the corresponding rendezvous method.

     *Usage:* :- `protocol(Protocol)'.
        - _Description:_ `Protocol' is the prefix to a library path
          where an active module rendezvous protocol can be found.

113.5 Other information (`agent_doc')
=====================================

This package is intended as a sample of how to program agents in
Ciao, based on active modules. It probably lacks many features that
an agent might need. In particular, it lacks language-independence:
it is thought for multi-agent systems where all agents are programmed
in Ciao.

   You are welcome to add any feature that you may be missing!

113.5.1 Platforms
-----------------

A platform is an active module which holds connection addresses of
agents in a multi-agent system. A protocol is provided which enables
the use of platforms: `agent/platformbased'. A suitable platform must
be up and running when agents which run under this protocol are
started up. The host id and port number (IP address/socket number) of
the platform must then be given as arguments to the agents
executables. The protocol also allows to give an agent name to the
agent upon start-up. A module suitable for a platform can be found in `library(actmods/examples/webbased_server/webbased_server)'.

113.6 Known bugs and planned improvements (`agent_doc')
=======================================================

   * Currently, the agent has to be compiled explicitely as an active
     module. The same protocol than in the agent source code must be
     used for this. Automatic compilation is not working.

   * It seems that there are running-ahead problems with threads that
     prevent to correctly publish agent addresses, sometimes.

114 Breadth-first execution
***************************

*Author(s):* Daniel Cabeza, Manuel Carro, Manuel Hermenegildo.

   This package implements breadth-first execution of predicates.
This may be useful in search problems when a proof procedure is
needed that will find all solutions (even if it may still loop for
some failures). This is in contrast with the default depth-first
search, which may loop in some cases even if there are correct
answers to a given query. This library is also useful when
experimenting with pure programs as well as when teaching logic
programming, for illustrating the expected theoretical results that
should be expected from the declarative semantics (see for example
the slides in `http://www.cliplab.org/proglog').

   It is important to realize, however, that the improved behaviour
of breadth first execution comes at a high (exponential!) price in
terms of both time ad memory. This library allows the programmer to
control this overhead by selecting which predicates will be executed
in breadth-first mode and which predicates in depth-first mode. More
concretely, predicates written with operators `'<-'/1' (facts) and `'<-'/2'
(clauses) are executed using breadth-first search, while predicates
using the standard syntax will be executed depth-first.

   The following example implements two versions of a predicate meant
to succeed if two nodes of a directed graph are connected. The
`chain/2' predicate (which will be executed depth-first) loops
without finding the connection between `a' and `d', while the
`bfchain/2' predicate (which will be executed breadth-first) will
find the connection correctly:

     :- module(chain, _, [bf]).

     test(bf) :- bfchain(a,d).
     test(df) :- chain(a,d).   % loops!

     bfchain(X,X) <- .
     bfchain(X,Y) <- arc(X,Z), bfchain(Z,Y).

     chain(X,X).
     chain(X,Y) :- arc(X,Z), chain(Z,Y).

     arc(a,b).
     arc(a,d).
     arc(b,c).
     arc(c,a).

   A second package, `'bf/bfall'', allows executing _all_ the
predicates in a given module in breadth-first mode. In this case,
predicates should be written using the standard syntax. This is
useful to be able to switch easily between depth-first and
breadth-first execution (e.g., for testing purposes) for all
predicates in a given module without having to modify the program.
The following program (written in standard syntax) runs breadth-first:

     :- module(chain_bfall, _, ['bf/bfall']).

     test :- chain(a,d).

     chain(X,X).
     chain(X,Y) :- arc(X,Z), chain(Z,Y).

     arc(a,b).
     arc(a,d).
     arc(b,c).
     arc(c,a).

   There is another version, package `'bf/af'', which ensures
AND-fairness by goal shuffling. This reduces the number of cases in
which an execution that is a failure loops instead (infinite
failures) at a small additional cost. For example, by using `'bf/af''
the following code correctly answers "`no'" when executing `test/0':

     :- module(sublistapp, [test/0, sublistapp/2], ['bf/af']).

     :- push_prolog_flag(unused_pred_warnings, no).

     test :- sublistapp([a], [b]).

     sublistapp(S, L) <- append(_, S, Y), append(Y, _, L).

     append([], L, L) <- .
     append([X|Xs], L, [X|Ys]) <- append(Xs, L, Ys).

     :- pop_prolog_flag(unused_pred_warnings).

   There is also a package `'bf/bfall'' which again allows executing
_all_ the predicates in a given module in breadth-first, and-fair
mode, where also all predicates should be written using the standard
syntax. This package offers (at a cost, of course) very nice results
for many programs, and is used extensively in programming courses by
the Ciao developers.

   Finally, it should be noted that a separate library, `id',
implements _iterative-deepening_ search, which can in many cases be a
better alternative to breadth-first search, since it achieves the
same improvement in the completeness results in many cases at a
greatly reduced execution cost (but the enumeration order of
solutions is not as nice, and that is why these packages are very
attractive for prototyping and teaching).

115 Iterative-deepening execution
*********************************

*Author(s):* Re'my Haemmerle', Manuel Carro, Claudio Vaucheret, Manuel
Hermenegildo.

   This package applies a _compiling control_ technique to implement _depth
first iterative deepening_ execution [Kor85]. It changes the usual
_depth-first_ computation rule by _iterative-deepening_ on those
predicates specifically marked. This is very useful in search
problems when a complete proof procedure is needed.

   When this computation rule is used, first all goals are expanded
only up to a given depth. If no solution is found or more solutions
are needed by backtracking, the depth limit is incremented and the
whole goal is repeated. Although it might seem that this approach is
very inefficient because all higher levels are repeated for the
deeper ones, it has been shown that is performs only about b/(b - 1)
times as many operations than the corresponding breadth-first search,
(where b is the branching factor of the proof tree) while the waste
of memory is the same as depth first.

   The usage is by means of the following directive:

   `:- iterative(Name, FirstCut, Formula).'

   which states than the predicate 'Name' given in functor/arity form
will be executed using iterative deepening rule starting at the depth
'FirstCut' with depth being incremented by the predicate 'Formula'.
This predicate compute the new depth using the previous one. It must
implement a dilating function i.e. the new depth must be greater. For
example, to start with depth 5 and increment by 10 you can write:

   `:- iterative(p/1,5,f).'

   `f(X,Y) :- Y is X + 10.'

   or if you prefer,

   `:- iterative(p/1,5,(_(X,Y):- Y is X + 10)).'

   You can also use a fourth parameter to set a limiting depth. All
goals below the given depth limit simply fail. Thus, with the
following directive:

   `:- iterative(p/1,5,(_(X,Y):- Y is X + 10),100).'

   all goals deeper than 100 will fail.

   An example of code using this package would be:

     :- module(example_id, _,[id]).

     test(id) :-
             idchain(a,d).
     test(df) :-
             chain(a,d).   % loops!

     :- iterative(idchain/2, 3, ( _(X,Z) :- Z is X + 1) ).

     idchain(X,X).
     idchain(X,Y) :-
             arc(X,Z),
             idchain(Z,Y).

     chain(X,X).
     chain(X,Y) :-
             arc(X,Z),
             chain(Z,Y).

     arc(a,b).
     arc(a,d).
     arc(b,c).
     arc(c,a).

   The order of solutions are first the shallower and then the
deeper. Solutions which are between two cutoff are given in the usual
left to right order. For example,

     :- module(_,_,[id]).

     % All goals deeper than 2 will fail
     :- iterative(p/1,0,(_(X,Z) :- Z is X + 1),2).

     % Change the solutions' order to goal p(X).
     %:- iterative(p/1,1,(_(X,Z) :- Z is X + 3)).

     p(X) :- q(X).
     p(a).

     q(X) :- r(X).

116.2.2 Meta-programming with CLP(Q)
------------------------------------

The implementation of CLP(Q) in Ciao compiles the constraints in the
program to a sequence of calls to the underlying constraints solver
(at compile-time). This results in efficient implementation, since
the structure of the constraints is processed only at compile-time,
but requires the constraints to be known at static time which can be
a limitation for metaprogramming-based applications such as static
program analyzers. For example, the call:

       ?- X=(A+B), Y=(C-D), X .>. Y.

       no

   fails because `X' `.>.' `Y' is translated first to a sequence of
calls that require (when they invoked) `X' and `Y' to be either
numbers or free variables. To overcome this limitation, you can use `clp_meta/1'
which delays the translation of the constraints from compile-time to
run-time (i.e., when `clp_meta/1' is called), For example:

     ?- X=(A+B),Y=(C-D), clp_meta([X .>. Y]).

     X = A+B,
     Y = C-D,
     C.<.D+A+B ?

   The argument of `clp_meta/1' accepts a goal or lists of goals,
where each goal is limited to conjunctions, disjunctions, or CLP(Q)
constraints. Other operations on constraints which are extensively
used in meta-programming, in particular in static program analysis,
are _projection_ and _entailment check_. The projection operation
restricts the constraints (that are available in the store) to a
given set of variables and turns the answer into terms. You can use
the multifile predicate `dump_constraints/3' for that purpose:

     ?- A .>. C, C .>. B, dump_constraints([A,B],[X,Y],Cs).

     Cs = [X.>.Y],
     C.>.B,
     C.<.A ?

     ?- C=(B+D), clp_meta([A .>. C, D .>. 0]), dump_constraints([A,B],[X,Y],Cs).

     C = B+D,
     Cs = [Y.<.X],
     D.<. -B+A,
     D.>.0 ?

   The _entailment check_ is used to check if a list of constrains is
entailed by the store. You can use the predicate `clp_entailed/1' for
that purpose:

     ?- A .>. C, C .>. B, B .>. D, clp_entailed([ A .>. B, A .>. D]).

     B.>.D,
     C.>.B,
     C.<.A ?

     yes

     ?- A .>=. B, clp_entailed([ A .>. B ]).

     no

118 Fuzzy Prolog
****************

*Author(s):* Claudio Vaucheret, Sergio Guadarrama, Francisco Bueno.

   This package impements an extension of prolog to deal with
uncertainty. We implement a fuzzy prolog that models interval-valued
fuzzy logic. This approach is more general than other fuzzy prologs
in two aspects:

  1. Truth values are sub-intervals on [0,1]. In fact, it could be a
     finite union of sub-intervals, as we will see below. Having a
     unique truth value is a particular case modeled with a unitary
     interval.

  2. Truth values are propagated through the rules by means of a set
     of _aggregation operators_. The definition of an _aggregation
     operator_ is a generalization that subsumes conjunctive
     operators (triangular norms as min, prod, etc.), disjunctive
     operators (triangular co-norms as max, sum, etc.), average
     operators (averages as arithmetic average, cuasi-linear average,
     etc.) and hybrid operators (combinations of previous operators).

   We add uncertainty using CLP(R) instead of implementing a new
fuzzy resolution as other fuzzy prologs. In this way, we use the
original inference mechanism of Prolog, and we use the constraints
and its operations provided by CLP(R) to handle the concept of
partial truth. We represent intervals as constrains over real numbers
and _aggregation operators_ as operations with constraints.

   Each fuzzy predicate has an additional argument which represents
its truth value. We use ":~" instead of ":-" to distinguish fuzzy
clauses from prolog clauses. In fuzzy clauses, truth values are
obtained via an aggregation operator. There is also some syntactic
sugar for defining fuzzy predicates with certain membership
functions, the fuzzy counterparts of crisp predicates, and the fuzzy
negation of a fuzzy predicate.

          `Domain', which is a list of pairs of domain-truth values,
          in increasing order and exhaustive. For example:
               young :# fuzzy_predicate([(0,1),(35,1),(45,0),(120,0)]).
          defines the predicate:
               young(X,1):- X .>=. 0, X .<. 35.
               young(X,M):- X .>=. 35, X .<. 45, 10*M .=. 45-X.
               young(X,0):- X .>=. 45, X .=<. 120.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Domain' is a list.   (basic_props:list/1)


 -- PREDICATE: fuzzy/1:
     *Usage:* `fuzzy(Name)'
        - _Description:_ Defines a fuzzy predicate as the fuzzy
          counterpart of a crisp predicate `Name'. For example,
               p_f :# fuzzy p/2
          defines a new fuzzy predicate `p_f/3' (the last argument is
          the truth value) with truth value equal to 0 if `p/2' fails
          and 1 otherwise.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Name' is a Name/Arity structure denoting a predicate name:
               predname(P/A) :-
                       atm(P),
                       nnegint(A).

          (basic_props:predname/1)


 -- PREDICATE: fnot/1:
     *Usage:* `fnot(Name)'
        - _Description:_ Defines a fuzzy predicate as the fuzzy
          negation of another fuzzy predicate `Name'. For example,
               notp_f :# fnot p_f/3
          defines the predicate:
               notp_f(X,Y,M) :-
                       p_f(X,Y,Mp),
                       M .=. 1 - Mp.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Name' is a Name/Arity structure denoting a predicate name:
               predname(P/A) :-
                       atm(P),
                       nnegint(A).

          (basic_props:predname/1)


 -- PREDICATE: :~/2:
     *Usage:* `:~(Head,Body)'
        - _Description:_ Defines a fuzzy clause for a fuzzy
          predicate. The clause contains calls to either fuzzy or
          crisp predicates. Calls to crisp predicates are
          automatically fuzzified. The last argument of `Head' is the
          truth value of the clause, which is obtained as the
          aggregation of the truth values of the body goals. An
          example:
               :- module(young2,_,[fuzzy]).

               young_couple(X,Y,Mu) :~ min
                       age(X,X1),
                       age(Y,Y1),
                       young(X1,MuX),
                       young(Y1,MuY).

               age(john,37).
               age(rose,39).

               young :# fuzzy_predicate([(0,1),(35,1),(45,0),(120,0)]).
          so that:
               ?- young_couple(john,rose,M).

               M .=. 0.6 ?

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

119 Object Oriented Programming
*******************************

*Author(s):* Angel Fernandez Pineda.

   O'Ciao is a set of libraries which allows object-oriented
programming in Ciao Prolog. It extends the Ciao Prolog module system
by introducing two new concepts:

   * Inheritance.

   * Instantiation.

   _Polymorphism_ is the third fundamental concept provided by object
oriented programming. This concept is not mentioned here since
*traditional PROLOG systems are polymorphic by nature*.

   Classes are declared in the same way as modules. However, they may
be enriched with inheritance declarations and other object-oriented
constructs. For an overview of the fundamentals of O'Ciao, see
`http://www.clip.dia.fi.upm.es/~clip/papers/ociao-tr.ps.gz'. However,
we will introduce the concepts in a tutorial way via examples.

119.1 Early examples
====================

The following one is a very simple example which declares a class - a
simple stack. Note that if you replace _class/1_ declaration with a
_module/1_ declaration, it will compile correctly, and can be used as
a normal Prolog module.

     %%----------------------------------------------%%
     %% A class for stacks.                          %%
     %%----------------------------------------------%%

     %% Class declaration: the current source defines a class.
     :- class(stack,[],[]).

     % State declaration: storage/1 is an attribute.
     :- dynamic storage/1.

     % Interface declaration: the following predicates will
     % be available at run-time.
     :- export(push/1).
     :- export(pop/1).
     :- export(top/1).
     :- export(is_empty/0).

     % Methods

     push(Item) :-
             nonvar(Item),
             asserta_fact(storage(Item)).

     pop(Item) :-
             var(Item),
             retract_fact(storage(Item)).

     top(Top) :-
             storage(Top), !.

     is_empty :-
             storage(_), !, fail.
     is_empty.

   If we load this code at the Ciao toplevel shell:

             ?- use_package(objects).

             yes
             ?- use_class(library('class/examples/stack')).

             yes
             ?-

   we can create two stack _instances_ :

             ?- St1 new stack,St2 new stack.

             St1 = stack('9254074093385163'),
             St2 = stack('9254074091') ? ,

   and then, we can operate on them separately:

             1 ?- St1:push(8),St2:push(9).

             St1 = stack('9254074093385163'),
             St2 = stack('9254074091') ?

             yes
             1 ?- St1:top(I),St2:top(K).

             I = 8,
             K = 9,
             St1 = stack('9254074093385163'),
             St2 = stack('9254074091') ?

             yes
             1 ?-

   The interesting point is that there are two stacks. If the
previous example had been a normal module, we would have a stack ,
but *only one* stack.

   The next example introduces the concepts of _inheritable_
predicate, _constructor_, _destructor_ and _virtual method_. Refer to
the following sections for further explanation.

     %%----------------------------------------------%%
     %% A generic class for item storage.            %%
     %%----------------------------------------------%%
     :- class(generic).

     % Public interface declaration:
     :- export([set/1,get/1,callme/0]).

     % An attribute
     :- data datum/1.

     % Inheritance declaration: datum/1 will be available to
     % descendant classes (if any).
     :- inheritable(datum/1).

     % Attribute initialization: attributes are easily initialized
     % by writing clauses for them.
     datum(none).

     % Methods

     set(X) :-
             type_check(X),
             set_fact(datum(X)).

     get(X) :-
             datum(X).

     callme :-
             a_virtual(IMPL),
             display(IMPL),
             display(' implementation of a_virtual/0 '),
             nl.

     % Constructor: in this case, every time an instance
     % of this class is created, it will display a message.
     generic :-
             display(' generic class constructor '),
             nl.

     % Destructor: analogous to the previous constructor,
     % it will display a message every time an instance
     % of this class is eliminated.
     destructor :-
             display(' generic class destructor '),
             nl.

     % Predicates:
     % cannot be called as messages (X:method)

     % Virtual declaration: tells the system to use the most
     % descendant implementation of a_virtual/1 when calling
     % it from inside this code (see callme/0).
     % If there is no descendant implementation for it,
     % the one defined bellow will be used.
     :- virtual a_virtual/1.

     a_virtual(generic).

     :- virtual type_check/1.

     type_check(X) :-
             nonvar(X).

   And the following example, is an extension of previous class. This
is performed by establishing an inheritance relationship:

     %%----------------------------------------------%%
     %% This class provides additional functionality %%
     %% to the "generic" class.                      %%
     %%----------------------------------------------%%
     :- class(specific).

     % Establish an inheritance relationship with class "generic".
     :- inherit_class(library('class/examples/generic')).

     % Override inherited datum/1.
     % datum/1 is said to be overriden because there are both an
     % inherited definition (from class "generic") and a local one,
     % which overrides the one inherited.
     :- data datum/1.
     :- inheritable datum/1.

     % Extend the public interface inherited from "generic".
     % note that set/1 and a_virtual/0 are also overriden.
     % undo/0 is a new functionality added.
     :- export([set/1,undo/0]).

     % Methods

     set(Value) :-
             inherited datum(OldValue),
             !,
             inherited set(Value),
             asserta_fact(datum(OldValue)).
     set(Value) :-
             inherited set(Value).

     undo :-
             retract_fact(datum(Last)), !,
             asserta_fact(inherited(datum(Last))).
     undo :-
             retractall_fact(inherited(datum(_))).

     % Constructor
     specific :-
             generic,
             retractall_fact(inherited(datum(_))),
             display(' specific class constructor '),
             nl.

     % Destructor
     destructor :-
             display(' specific class destructor '),
             nl.

     % Predicates

     % New implementation of a_virtual/1.
     % Since this predicate was declared virtual, the
     % implementation below will be called from the inherited
     % method callme/0 instead of the version defined at "generic".
     a_virtual(specific).

119.2 Recommendations on when to use objects
============================================

We would like to give some advice in the use of object oriented
programming, in conjunction with the declarative paradigm.

   You should reconsider using O'Ciao in the following cases:

   * The pretended "objects" have no state,i.e., no data or dynamic
     predicates. In this case, a normal module will suffice.

   * There is state, but there will be only one instance of a
     pretended class. Again, a module suffices.

   * The "objects" are data structures (list,trees,etc) already
     supported by Prolog. However, it does make sense to model, using
     objects, data structures whose change implies a side-effect such
     as drawing a particular window on the screen.


   We recommend the usage of O'Ciao in the following cases:

   * You feel you will need to have several copies of a "module".

   * Local copies of a module are needed instead of a global module
     beeing modified by several ones.

   * The "classes" are a representation of external entities to
     Prolog. For example: the X-Window system.

   * There is state or code outside the Prolog system which needs to
     be manipulated. For example: interfaces to Java or Tcl/Tk code.

   * You are not familiar with Prolog, but you know about object
     oriented programming. O'Ciao may be used as a learning tool to
     introduce yourself on the declarative programming paradigm.



File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Limitations on object usage,  Prev: Recommendations on when to use objects,  Up: Object Oriented Programming

119.3 Limitations on object usage
=================================

O'Ciao run-time speed is limited by the usage of meta-programming
structures, for instance: `X = (Object:mymethod(25)), call(X)'.
O'Ciao will optimize static manipulation of objects (those that can
be determined at compile time).

120 Declaring classes and interfaces
************************************

*Author(s):* Angel Fernandez Pineda.

   O'Ciao classes are declared in the same way as traditional prolog
modules. The general mechanism of _source expansion_ will translate
object-oriented declarations to normal prolog code. This is done
transparently to the user.

   Abstract _interfaces_ are restricted classes which declare
exported predicates with no implementation. The implementation itselt
will be provided by some class using an `implements/1' declaration.
Only `export/1' and `data/1' declarations are allowed when declaring
an interface. Normal classes may treated as interfaces just ignoring
all exported predicate implementations.

120.1 Usage and interface (`class_doc')
=======================================

   * *Library usage:*

     To declare a class the compiler must be told to use the `class'
     _source expansion_. To do so, source code must start with a
     module declaration which loads the class package:
                     :- class(ClassName).
     or a `module/3' declaration, as follows:
                     :- module(ClassName,[],[class]).

     interfaces are declared in a similar way:
                     :- interface(InterfaceName).

     Please, do not use SICStus-like module declaration, with a
     non-empty export list. In other case, some non-sense errors will
     be reported by normal Ciao module system.

     Most of the regular Ciao declarations may be used when defining
     a class, such as `concurrent/1', `dynamic/1', `discontiguous/1', `multifile/1',
     and so on.

     However, there are some restrictions wich apply to those
     declarations:
        * `meta_predicate/1' declaration is not allowed to hold _addmodule
          and pred(N) meta-arguments_, except for previously declared
          multifiles.

        * Attribute and multifile predicates must be declared before
          any clause of the related predicate.

        * There is no sense in declaring an attribute as
          meta_predicate.

     It is a good practique to put all your declarations at the very
     begining of the file, just before the code itself.

   * *Exports:*

        - _Predicates:_

          `inherited/1', `self/1', `constructor/0', `destructor/0'.

   * *New declarations defined:*

     `export/1', `public/1', `inheritable/1', `data/1', `dynamic/1', `concurrent/1', `inherit_class/1', `implements/1', `virtual/1'.

   * *Other modules used:*

        - _System library modules:_

          `objects/objects_rt'.

120.2 Documentation on new declarations (`class_doc')
=====================================================

 -- DECLARATION: export/1:
     Declares a method or attribute to be part of the _public
     interface_.

     The public interface is the set of predicates wich will be
     accesible from any code establishing an usage relationship with
     this class (see `use_class/1' for further information).

     Publishing an attribute or method is very similar to _exporting_
     a predicate in a Prolog module.

     Whether an inherited and exported predicate is overriden, it
     must be explicitly exported again.

     An inherited (but not exported) predicate may become exported,
     without overriding it by the usage of this declaration.

     *Usage:* :- `export(Spec)'.
        - _Description:_ `Spec' will be part of the public (exported)
          interface.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Spec' is a method or attribute specification.
          (objects_rt:method_spec/1)


 -- DECLARATION: public/1:
     Just an alias for `export/1'.

     *Usage:* :- `public(Spec)'.
        - _Description:_ This declaration may be used instead of `export/1'.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Spec' is a method or attribute specification.
          (objects_rt:method_spec/1)


 -- DECLARATION: inheritable/1:
     Declares a method or attribute to be inherited by descendant
     classes. Notice that all *public predicates are inheritable by
     default*. There is no need to mark them as inheritable.

     Traditionaly, object oriented languages makes use of the _protected_
     concept. Inheritable/1 may be used as the same concept.

     The set of inheritable predicates is called the _inheritable
     interface_.

     *Usage:* :- `inheritable(MethodSpec)'.
        - _Description:_ `MethodSpec' is accessible to descendant
          classes.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `MethodSpec' is a method or attribute specification.
          (objects_rt:method_spec/1)


 -- DECLARATION: data/1:
     Declares an _attribute_ at current class. Attributes are used to
     build the internal state of instances. So, each instance will
     own a particular copy of those attribute definitions. In this
     way, one instance may have different state from another.

     O'Ciao attributes are restricted to hold simple facts. It is not
     possible to hold a Head :- Body clause at an instance attribute.

     Notice that attributes are _multi-evaluated_ by nature, and may
     be manipulated by the habitual *assert/retract* family of
     predicates.

     Attributes may also be initialized. In order to do so, simply
     put some clauses after the attribute definition. Each time an
     instance is created, its initial state will be built from those _initialization
     clauses_.

     Note: whether a data/1 declaration appears inside an interface,
     it will be automatically exported.

     *Usage:* :- `data Spec'.
        - _Description:_ `Spec' is an attribute.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Spec' is a method or attribute specification.
          (objects_rt:method_spec/1)


 -- DECLARATION: dynamic/1:
     Just an alias for `data/1'.

     *Usage:* :- `dynamic Spec'.
        - _Description:_ You may use this declaration instead of `data/1'.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Spec' is a method or attribute specification.
          (objects_rt:method_spec/1)


 -- DECLARATION: concurrent/1:
     Declares a _concurrent attribute_ at current class. Concurrent
     attributes are just the same as normal attributes, those
     declared using `data/1', except for they may freeze the calling
     thread instead of failing when no more choice points are
     remaining on the concurrent attribute.

     In order to get more information about concurrent behavior take
     a look to the concurrent/1 built-in declaration on Ciao Prolog
     module system.

     *Usage:* :- `concurrent Spec'.
        - _Description:_ Declares `Spec' to be a concurrent attribute.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Spec' is a method or attribute specification.
          (objects_rt:method_spec/1)


 -- DECLARATION: inherit_class/1:
     Makes any public and/or inheritable predicate at inherited class
     to become accesible by any instance derived from current class.

     Inherited class is also called the _super class_.

     Only one inherit_class/1 declaration is allowed to be present at
     current source.

     Notice that inheritance is public by default. Any public and/or
     inheritable declaration will remain the same to descendant
     classes. However, any inherited predicate may be _overriden_
     (redefined).

     A predicate is said to be _overriden_ when it has been inherited
     from super class, but there are clauses (or a `data/1'
     declaration) present at current class for such a predicate.

     Whether a *public* predicate is overriden, the local definition
     must also be exported, otherwise an error is reported.

     Whether an *inheritable* predicate (not public) is overriden,
     the local definition must also be marked as inheritable or
     exported, otherwise an error is also reported.

     Note: whether inherit_class/1 appears inside an interface, it
     will be used as an `implements/1' declaration.

     *Usage:* :- `inherit_class(Source)'.
        - _Description:_ Establish an _inheritance relationship_
          between current class and the class defined at `Source'
          file.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Source' is a valid path to a prolog file containing a
          class declaration (without .pl extension).
          (objects_rt:class_source/1)


 -- DECLARATION: implements/1:
     Forces current source to provide an implementation for the given
     interface file. Such interface file may declare another class or
     a specific interface.

     Every public predicate present at given interface file will be
     automatically declared as public at current source, so you
     *must* provide an implementation for such predicates.

     The effect of this declaration is called _interface
     inheritance_,and there is no restriction on the number of
     implements/1 declarations present at current code.

     *Usage:* :- `implements(Interface)'.
        - _Description:_ Current source is supposed to provide an
          implementation for `Interface'.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Interface' is a valid path to a prolog file containing a
          class declaration or an interface declaration (without .pl
          extension).   (objects_rt:interface_source/1)


 -- DECLARATION: virtual/1:
     This declaration may be used whenever descendant classes are to
     implement different versions of a given predicate.

     _virtual_ predicates give a chance to handle, in an uniform way,
     different implementations of the same functionality.

     Whether a virtual predicate is declared as a method, there must
     be at least one clause of it present at current source. Whenever
     no special implementation is needed at current class, a
     never-fail/allways-fail clause may be defined (depending on your
     needs). For example:

             :- virtual([ test1/1 , test2/2 ]).
             test1(_).
             test2(_,_) :- fail.

     This kind of virtual methods are also known as _abstract
     methods_, since implementation is fully delegated to descendant
     classes.

     An attribute may be also declared as a virtual one, but there is
     no need to write clauses for it.

     *Usage:* :- `virtual(VirtualMethodSpec)'.
        - _Description:_ All calls to `VirtualMethodSpec' predicate
          in current source will use the most descendant
          implementation of it.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `VirtualMethodSpec' is a method specification.
          (objects_rt:virtual_method_spec/1)

120.3 Documentation on exports (`class_doc')
============================================

 -- PREDICATE: inherited/1:
     This predicate qualificator may be used whenever you need to
     reference an attribute or method on the super class.

     Since methods and attributes may be redefined, this qualificator
     is need to distinguish between a locally declared predicate and
     the inherited one, which has the same name.

     There is no need to use inherited/1 if a particular inherited
     predicate has not been redefined at current class.

     *Usage:* `inherited(Goal)'
        - _Description:_ References a given `Goal' at the super class

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Goal' is a term which represents a goal, i.e., an atom or
          a structure.   (basic_props:callable/1)


 -- PREDICATE: self/1:
     Determines which instance is currently executing self/1 goal.

     Predicate will fail if argument is not a free variable.
     Otherwise, it will allways succeed, retrieving the instance
     identifier which is executing current code.

     This functionality is very usefull since an object must have
     knowledge of other object's identifier in order to send messages
     to it.For example:

     :- concurrent ack/0.

     send_data_to_object(Data,Obj) :- self(X), Obj:take_this(Data,X),
     current_fact(ack).

     acknowledge :- asserta_fact(ack).

     take_this(Data,Sender) :- validate_data(Data),
     Sender:acknowledge.

     *Usage:* `self(Variable)'
        - _Description:_ Retrieves current instance identifier in
          `Variable'

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Variable' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Variable' is an unique term which identifies an object.
          (objects_rt:instance_id/1)


 -- PREDICATE: constructor/0:
     A _constructor_ is a special case of method which complains the
     following conditions:

        * The constructor functor matches the current class name.

        * A constructor may hold any number of arguments.

        * If an inheritance relationship was defined, an inherited
          constructor must be manually called (see below).

        * When instance creation takes place, any of the declared
          constructors are implicitly called. The actual constructor
          called depends on the `new/2' goal specified by the user.

     This is a simple example of constructor declaration for the foo
     class:

                     foo :-
                         display('an instance was born').

     Constructor declaration is not mandatory, and there may be more
     than one constructor declarations (with different arity) at the
     source code.

     This functionality is usefull when some computation is needed at
     instance creation. For example: opening a socket, clearing the
     screen, etc.

     Whenever an inheritance relationship is established, and there
     is any constructor defined at the super class, you must call
     manually an inherited constructor. Here is an example:

                     :- class(foo).
                     :- inherit_class(myclass).

                     foo :-
                         myclass(0),
                         display('an instance was born').

                     foo(N) :- myclass(N).

     Consequences may be unpredictable, if you forget to call an
     inherited constructor. You should also take care not to call an
     inherited constructor twice.

     All defined constructors are inheritable by default. A
     constructor may also be declared as public (by the user), but it
     is not mandatory.

     *Usage:*
        - _Description:_ Constructors are implicitly declared


 -- PREDICATE: destructor/0:
     A _destructor_ is a special case of method which will be
     automatically called when instance destruction takes place.

     A destructor will never be wanted to be part of the public
     interface, and there is no need to mark them as inheritable,
     since all inherited destructors are called by O'Ciao just before
     yours.

     This is a simple example of destructor declaration:

                     destructor :-
                         display('goodbye, cruel world!!!').

     Destructor declaration is not mandatory. Failure or sucess of
     destructors will be ignored by O'Ciao, and they will be called
     only once.

     This functionality is useful when some computation is need at
     instance destruction. For example: closing an open file.

     *Usage:*
        - _Description:_ Destructors are implicitly declared

120.4 Other information (`class_doc')
=====================================

This describes the errors reported when declaring a class or an
interface. The first section will explain compile-time errors, this
is, any semantic error which may be determined at compile time. The
second section will explain run-time errors, this is, any exception
that may be raisen by the incorrect usage of O'Ciao. Some of those
errors may be not reported at compile time, due to the use of
meta-programational structures. For example:

   `functor(X,my_method,0),call(X).'

   O'Ciao is not able to check whether my_method/0 is a valid method
or not. So, this kind of checking is left to run time.

120.4.1 Class and Interface error reporting at compile time
-----------------------------------------------------------

   * *ERROR : multiple inheritance not allowed.*

     There are two or more inherit_class/1 declarations found at your
     code. Only one declaration is allowed, since there is no
     multiple code inheritance support.

   * *ERROR : invalid inheritance declaration.*

     The given parameter to inherit_class/1 declaration is not a
     valid path to a Prolog source.

   * *ERROR : sorry, addmodule meta-arg is not allowed at _F/A_. *

     You are trying to declare _F/A_ as meta-predicate, and one of
     the meta-arguments is _addmodule_. This is not allowed in O'Ciao
     due to implementation restrictions. For example:

     `:- meta_predicate example(addmodule).'

     `example(X,FromModule) :- call(FromModule:X).'

   * *ERROR : invalid attribute declaration for _Arg_. *

     Argument to data/1 or dynamic/1 declaration is not a valid
     predicate specification of the form _Functor/Arity_. For example:

     `:- data attr.'

     `:- dynamic attr(_).'

     `:- data attr/m.'

     etc,etc...

   * *ERROR : pretended attribute _F/A_ was assumed to be a method.*

     You put some clauses of _F/A_ before the corresponding data/1 or
     dynamic/1 declaration. For example:

     `attr(initial_value).'

     `:- data attr/1.'

     It is a must to declare attributes before any clause of the
     given predicate.

   * *ERROR : destructor/0 is not allowed to be an attribute.*

     There is a :- data(destructor/0) or :- dynamic(destructor/0).
     declaration in your code. This is not allowed since destructor/0
     is a reserved predicate, and must be allways a method.

   * *ERROR : _Constructor_ is not allowed to be an attribute.*

     As the previos error, you are trying to declare a constructor as
     an attribute. A constructor must be allways a method.

   * *ERROR : invalid multifile: destructor/0 is a reserved
     predicate.*

     There is a :- multifile(destructor/0). declaration in your code.
     This is not allowed since destructor/0 is a reserved predicate,
     and must be allways a method.

   * *ERROR : invalid multifile: _Constructor_ is a reserved
     predicate.*

     As the previos error, you are trying to declare a constructor as
     a multifile. Any constructor must allways be a method.

   * *ERROR : multifile declaration of _F/A_ ignored: it was assumed
     to be a method.*

     You put some clauses of _F/A_ before the corresponding
     multifile/1 declaration. For example:

     example(a,b).

     `:- multifile example/2.'

     Multifile predicates must be declared before any clause of the
     given predicate.

   * *ERROR : invalid multifile declaration: multifile(_Arg_). *

     Given argument to multifile/1 declaration is not a valid
     predicate specification, of the form _Functor/Arity_.

   * *ERROR : invalid public declaration: _Arg_. *

     Given argument _Arg_ to public/1 or export/1 declaration is not
     a valid predicate specification, of the form _Functor/Arity_.

   * *ERROR : invalid inheritable declaration: inheritable(_Arg_). *

     Given argument _Arg_ to inheritable/1 declaration is not a valid
     predicate specification, of the form _Functor/Arity_.

   * *ERROR : destructor/0 is not allowed to be virtual.*

     There is a :- virtual(destructor/0) declaration present at your
     code. Destructors and/or constructors are not allowed to be
     virtual.

   * *ERROR : _Constructor_ is not allowed to be virtual.*

     As the previous error, you are trying to declare a constructor
     as virtual. This is not allowed.

   * *ERROR : invalid virtual declaration: virtual(_Arg_). *

     Given argument to virtual/1 declaration is not a valid predicate
     specification, of the form _Functor/Arity_.

   * *ERROR : clause of _F/A_ ignored : only facts are allowed as
     initial state.*

     You declared _F/A_ as an attribute, then you put some clauses of
     that predicate in the form _Head :- Body_. For example:

     `:- data my_attribute/1.'

     `my_attribute(X) :- X>=0 , X<=2.'

     This is not allowed since attributes are assumed to hold simple
     facts. The correct usage for those _initialization clauses_ is:

     `:- data my_attribute/1.'

     `my_attribute(0).'

     `my_attribute(1).'

     `my_attribute(2).'

   * *ERROR : multifile _F/A_ is not allowed to be public.*

     The given _F/A_ predicate is both present at multifile/1 and
     public/1 declarations. For example:

     `:- public(p/1).'

     `:- multifile(p/1).'

     This is not allowed since multifile predicates are not related
     to Object Oriented Programming.

   * *ERROR : multifile _F/A_ is not allowed to be inheritable.*

     Analogous to previous error.

   * *ERROR : multifile _F/A_ is not allowed to be virtual.*

     Analogous to previous error.

   * *ERROR : virtual _F/A_ must be a method or attribute defined at
     this class.*

     There is a virtual/1 declaration for _F/A_, but there is not any
     clause of that predicate nor a `data/1' declaration. You must
     declare at least one clause for every virtual method. Virtual
     attributes does not require any clause but a `data/1'
     declaration must be present.

   * *ERROR : implemented interface _Module_ is not a valid
     interface.*

     There is an `implements/1' declaration present at your code
     where given _Module_ is not declared as class nor interface.

   * *ERROR : predicate _F/A_ is required both as method (at _Itf1_
     interface) and attribute (at _Itf2_ interface).*

     There is no chance to give a correct implementation for _F/A_
     predicate since _Itf1_ and _Itf2_ interfaces require different
     definitions. To avoid this error, you must remove one of the
     related `implements/1' declaration.

   * *ERROR : inherited _Source_ must be a class.*

     There is an :- inherit_class(_Source_) declaration, but that
     source was not declared as a class.

   * *ERROR : circular inheritance: _Source_ is not a valid
     super-class.*

     Establishing an inheritance relationship with _Source_ will
     cause current class to be present twice in the inheritance line.
     This is not allowed. The cause of this is error is simple :
     There is some inherited class from _Source_ which also
     establishes an inheritance relationship with current source.

   * *ERROR : method/attribute _F/A_ must be implemented.*

     Some of the implemented interfaces requires _F/A_ to be defined,
     but there is no definition for such predicate, even an inherited
     one.

   * *ERROR : local implementation of _F/A_ hides inheritable/public
     definition.*

     There is an inherited definition for _F/A_ which is been
     redefined at current class, but there is no valid
     inheritable/public declaration for the last one. Overriden
     public predicates must be also declared as public. Overriden
     inheritable predicates must be declared either as public or
     inheritable.

   * *ERROR : public predicate _F/A_ was not defined nor inherited.*

     There is a `public/1' declaration for _F/A_, but there is no
     definition for it at current class nor an inherited one.

   * *ERROR : argument to self/1 must be a free variable.*

     Argument to self/1 is not a variable, for example: `self(abc)'.

   * *ERROR : unknown inherited attribute in _Goal_.*

     _Goal_ belongs to assert/retract family of predicates, and given
     argument is not a valid inherited attribute. The most probable
     causes of this error are:

        * The given predicate is defined at super-class, but you
          forgot to mark it as inheritable (or public), at such class.

        * The given predicate was not defined (at super-class) as an
          attribute, just as a method.

   * *ERROR : unknown inherited goal: _Goal_.*

     The given _Goal_ was not found at super-class, or it is not
     accessible. Check whether _Goal_ was marked as inheritable (or
     public) at super-class.

   * *ERROR : invalid argument: _F/A_ is not an attribute.*

     You are trying to pass a method as an argument to any predicate
     which expect a _fact_ predicate.

   * *ERROR : unknown inherited fact: _Fact_.*

     There is a call to any predicate which expects a _fact_ argument
     (those declared as data or dynamic),but the actual argument is
     not an inherited attribute.For example:

     `asserta_fact(inherited(not_an_attribute(8)))'

     where not_an_attribute/1 was not declared as data or dynamic by
     the super-class (or corresponding ascendant).

   * *ERROR : unknown inherited spec: _F/A_.*

     There is a reference to an inherited predicate specification,
     but the involved predicate has not been inherited.

   * *WARNING : meta-predicate specification of _F/A_ ignored since
     this is an attribute.*

     You declared _F/A_ both as an attribute and a meta-predicate.
     For example:

     `:- meta_predicate attr(goal).'

     `:- data attr/1.'

     There is no sense in declaring an attribute as meta-predicate.

   * *WARNING : class destructor is public*

     There is a :- public(destructor/0) declaration present at your
     code. Marking a destructor as public is a very bad idea since
     anybody may destroy or corrupt an instance before the proper
     time.

   * *WARNING : class destructor is inheritable*

     Analogous to previous error.

   * *WARNING : There is no call to inherited constructor/s*

     You have not declared any constructor at your class, but there
     is any inherited constructor that should be called. Whenever you
     do not need constructors, but there is an inheritance
     relationship (where super-class declares a constructor), you
     should write a simple constructor as the following example:
             :- class(myclass).
             :- inherit_class(other_class).

             myclass :-
                     other_class.

   * *WARNING : multifile _F/A_ hides inherited predicate.*

     You declared as multifle a predicate which matches an inherited
     predicate name. Any reference to the inherited predicate must be
     done by the ways of the inherited/1 qualificator.

120.4.3 Normal Prolog module system interaction
-----------------------------------------------

O'Ciao works in conjunction with the Ciao Prolog module system, which
also reports its own error messages. This will cause Ciao to report a
little criptic error messages due to the general mechanism of
source-to-source expansion. Those are some tips you must consider
when compiling a class:

   * Any error relative to method 'm' with arity A will be reported
     for predicate 'obj$m'/A+1. For example :

     `WARNING: (lns 28-30) [Item,Itema] - singleton variables in
     obj$remove/2'

     This error is relative to method remove/1.

   * `set_prolog_flag/1' declaration will be usefull when declaring
     multiple constructors. It will avoid some awful warnings.
     Example:

             :- class(myclass).

             %% Use this declaration whenever several constructors are needed.

             :- set_prolog_flag(multi_arity_warnings,off).

             myclass(_).

121.1 Usage and interface (`objects_doc')
=========================================

   * *Library usage:*

     Any code which needs to use objects must include the objects
     package:
              :- module(_ModuleName_,_Exports_,[objects]).
     You can use objects even if your code is a class. Note that
     declaring a class does not automatically enables the code to
     create instances.
              :- class(_ModuleName_,[],[objects]).

     This package enables both static and dynamic usage of objects.

   * *New declarations defined:*

     ` use_class/1', ` instance_of/2', ` new/2'.

   * *Other modules used:*

        - _System library modules:_

          `objects/objects_rt'.

121.2 Documentation on new declarations (`objects_doc')
=======================================================

 -- DECLARATION: use_class/1:
     It establishes an usage relationship between the given file
     (which is supposed to declare a class) and current source. Usage
     relationships are needed in order to enable code to create
     instances of the given class, and to make calls to instances
     derived from such class.

     Since an interface is some kind of class, they may be used
     within this declaration but only for semantic checking
     porpouses. Instances will not be derived from interfaces.

     use_class/1 is used in the same way as `use_module/1'.

     *Usage:* :- ` use_class(ClassSource)'.
        - _Description:_ Establish usage relationship with
          `ClassSource'.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `ClassSource' is a valid path to a prolog file containing a
          class declaration (without .pl extension).
          (objects_rt:class_source/1)


 -- DECLARATION: instance_of/2:
     Statically declares an identifier to be an instance of a given
     class.

     It may be used as `new/2' predicate except for:
        * The instance identifier will not be a variable, it must be
          provided by the user, and must be unique.

        * Instance creation will never fail, even if the constructor
          fails.

     For every statically declared object the given constructor will
     be called at program startup. Those instances may be destroyed
     manually, but it is not recommended.

     When reloading the involved class from the Ciao toplevel shell.
     It may destroy statically declared instances, and create them
     again.

     Statically declared instances must be called using a
     specifically designed module-qualification:
     `ClassName(Object):Goal'. For example:
              :- module(example,[main/0],[objects]).
              :- use_class(library(counter)).
              :- cnt instance_of counter(10).

              main :-
                   counter(cnt):decrease(1),
                   counter(cnt):current_value(X),
                   display(X).
     But *statically written code* (only) is allowed to use
     module-style qualifications as a macro:
              main :-
                   cnt:decrease(1),
                   cnt:current_value(X),
                   display(X).
     Notice that dynamically expanded goals such as
     `X=cnt,X:decrease(1)' will not work, use
     `X=counter(cnt),X:decrease(1)' instead.

     *Usage:* :- ` instance_of(Object,Constructor)'.
        - _Description:_ Declares `Object' to be an instance of the
          class denoted by `Constructor'.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Object' is an unique term which identifies an object.
          (objects_rt:instance_id/1)

          `Constructor' is a term whose functor matches a class name.
          (objects_rt:constructor/1)


 -- DECLARATION: new/2:
     This declaration has the same effect as ` instance_of/2'.

     *Usage:* :- ` new(Object,Constructor)'.
        - _Description:_ Just an alias for ` instance_of/2'.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Object' is an unique term which identifies an object.
          (objects_rt:instance_id/1)

          `Constructor' is a term whose functor matches a class name.
          (objects_rt:constructor/1)

121.3 Other information (`objects_doc')
=======================================

Compile-time errors are restricted to some local analysis. Since
there is no type declaration in the Prolog language, there is no
posibility to determine whenever a given variable will hold an
instance of any class.

   However, little semantic analysis is performed. User may aid to
perform such an analysis by the usage of run time checks (which are
also detected at compile time), or static declarations. For example:

   `clause(Obj) :- Obj:a_method(334).'

   O'Ciao may be not able to determine whenever a_method/1 is a valid
method for instance Obj, unless some help is provided:

   `clause(Obj) :- Obj instance_of myclass,Obj:a_method(334).'

   In such case, O'Ciao will report any semantic error at
compile-time.

   Most of the run-time errors are related to normal Ciao Prolog
module system. Since objects are treated as normal Prolog modules at
run time, there is no further documentation here about that stuff.

121.3.1 Error reporting at compile time (objects)
-------------------------------------------------

   * *ERROR : invalid instance identifier _ID_: must be an atom*

     There is a `instance_of/2' or `new/2' declaration where first
     argument _ID_ must be an unique atom, but currently it is not.
     Statically declared instances needs an identifier to be provided
     by the user.

   * *ERROR : instance identifier _ID_ already in use*

     There are two or more `instance_of/2' declarations with the same
     first argument _ID_. Instance identifiers must be unique.

   * *ERROR : invalid use_class/1 declaration: _SourceFile_ is not a
     class*

     Those are the causes for this error:

        * The given _SourceFile_ does not exist, or is not accesible.

        * The given _SourceFile_ is not a Prolog source.

        * The given _SourceFile_ is a valid Prolog source, but it
          does not declare a class.


   * *ERROR : unknown class on _ID_ instance declaration*

     The class defined on the `instance_of/2' declaration for _ID_
     instance has not been loaded by a `use_class/1' declaration.

   * *ERROR : instance identifier _ID_ is an exisisting Prolog module*

     There is an statically declared instance whose identifier may
     cause interference with the Ciao Prolog module system. Use
     another instance identifier.

   * *ERROR : unknown constructor on _ID_ instance declaration*

     The given constructor on the `instance_of/2' declaration for
     _ID_ has not been defined at the corresponding class.

   * *ERROR : constructor is needed on _ID_ instance declaration*

     No constructor was defined on the `instance_of/2' declaration
     for _ID_ and default constructor is not allowed. You must
     provide a constructor.

   * *ERROR : static instance _ID_ was derived from a different
     constructor at _AnotherModule_*

     _ID_ has been declared to be an static instance both on
     _AnotherModule_ and current source, but different constructors
     were used. The most probable causes for this error are:

        * Occasionally, there is another module using the same
          instance identifier and it was not noticed by you. Another
          different identifier may be used instead.

        * It was you intention to use the same object as declared by
          the other module. In this case, the same constructor must
          be used.


   * *ERROR : invalid first argument in call to new(_Arg_,_)*

     There is a new/1 goal in your code where first argument is not a
     free variable. For example:

     `myobj new myclass'

     First argument must be a variable in order to receive a run-time
     generated object identifier.

   * *ERROR : unknown class in call to new(?,_Constructor_) *

     The given _Constructor_ in call to new/2 does not correspond to
     any used class at current code. The most probable cause of this
     may be:

        * You forgot to include a `use_class/1' declaration in your
          code.

        * There is a spelling mistake in the constructor.For example:

          :- use_class(myclass).

          foo(X) :- X new mclass.


   * *ERROR : can not create an instance from an interface:
     new(?,_Constructor_) *

     Given _Constructor_ references an interface rather than a class.
     Instances can not be derived from interface-expanded code.

   * *ERROR : unknown constructor in call to new(?,_Constructor_) *

     As the previous error, there is a mistake in the given
     _Constructor_. This error is reported when you are trying to
     call a constructor which was not defined at the corresponding
     class. Check the class definition to find what is going on.

     Another cause for this error is the incorrect usage of the default
     constructor. Whenever there are one or more constructors defined
     at the involved class, you are restricted to chose one of them.
     This seems that default constructor will be available, if and
     only if, there are no constructors defined at the involved class.

   * *ERROR : call to non-public _ID:Goal_*

     You are trying to call a method which was not declared as public
     by the class specified in `instance_of/2' declaration for _ID_.

   * *ERROR : call to inaccessible predicate at instance _ID:Goal_*

     There is a call to _Goal_ at statically declared instance _ID_
     which is unknown or was not declared as public.

   * *ERROR : unknown instance _ID_ of class _Class_ at _Goal_*

     There is a call to _Goal_ where involved statically declared
     instance _ID_ is unknown or is not derived from _Class_. Check
     whether it was declared by a `instance_of/2' declaration.

   * *ERROR : inaccessible attribute _Fact_ at instance _ID_*

     There is an attempt to use _ID:Fact_ but it was not declared as
     public.

   * *ERROR : unknown attribute _Fact_ at instance _ID_*

     There is an attempt to use _ID:Fact_ but it is unknown or it is
     not an attribute (may be a method).

   * *WARNING : invalid call to new(?,_)*

     There is a call to new/2 in you code where first argument
     variable has been determined to hold any other instance. For
     example:

     `foo :- X new myclass,X new otherclass.'

     or

     `foo(X) :- X instance_of myclass, X new myclass.'

     The related call to new/2 will allways fail.

   * *WARNING : called _Goal_ is not public at any used class*

     There is a call to _Var_:_Goal_ where _Var_ has not been
     determined to be compatible with any class. However, _Goal_ is
     not public at any class specified by the `use_class/1'
     declaration.

     This is a warning (not an error) since _Var_:_Goal_ may be not
     related to Object Oriented Programing.

121.3.2 Error reporting at run time (objects)
---------------------------------------------

   * *EXCEPTION : instantiation_error( '1st argument must be free
     variable')*

     Calling to new/1 requieres first argument to be a free variable.
     For example:

     `X = this_will_raise_an_exception,X new myclass.'

   * *EXCEPTION : instantiation_error('class not given')*

     You called new/2 using a free variable as second argument.

   * *EXCEPTION : instantiation_error(inaccesible_class(_Class_),
     from(_Module_)) *

     _Module_ tried to create an instance of _Class_ by the ways of
     new/2, but there is no usage relationship between _Module_ and
     _Class_.

   * *EXCEPTION : instantiation_error(invalid_constructor(

122 Run time usage of objects
*****************************

*Author(s):* Angel Fernandez Pineda, Angel Fernandez Pineda.

   This library provides run-time support for object creation and
manipulation. Objects are also called class instances, or simply instances.

   Objects in Ciao are treated as normal modules. This is, an object
is a run-time generated Prolog module, which may be identified by an
unique term across the whole application.

   This is a very simple example of how to create an instance, and
how to make calls to it:

                 AnObj new myclass,
                 AnObj:mymethod.

   In order to make any object accessible from code, an usage
relationship must be established between the class (from which
instances are derived) and the code itself. Refer to `use_class/1'
predicate or `use_class/1' declaration in order to do so.

122.1 Usage and interface (`objects_rt')
========================================

   * *Library usage:*

     This library is automatically loaded when using the _objects_
     package:
              :- module(_ModuleName_,_Exports_,[objects]).
     Nothing special needs to be done.

   * *Exports:*

        - _Predicates:_

          `new/2', `instance_of/2', `derived_from/2', `interface/2', `instance_codes/2', `destroy/1', `use_class/1'.

        - _Properties:_

          `constructor/1', `class_name/1', `interface_name/1', `instance_id/1', `class_source/1', `interface_source/1', `method_spec/1', `virtual_method_spec/1'.

   * *Other modules used:*

        - _System library modules:_

          `compiler/compiler', `prolog_sys'.

122.2 Documentation on exports (`objects_rt')
=============================================

 -- PREDICATE: new/2:
     Dynamic instance creation takes place by the ways of this
     predicate.

     It takes a free variable as first argument which will be
     instantiated to an internal object identifier.

     Second argument must be instantiated to a class constructor.
     Class constructors are designed to perform an initialization on
     the new created instance. Notice that instance initialization
     may involve some kind of computation, not only _state
     initialization_.

     A class constructor is made by a functor, which must match the
     intended class name, and any number of parameters. For example:

                      Obj new myclass(1500,'hello, world!!!')

     Those parameters depends (obviously) on the constructors defined
     at the class source. If no constructors where defined, no
     parameters are needed. This is called the default constructor.
     An example:

                      Obj new myclass

     The default constructor can not be called if there is any
     constructor available at the class source.

     Instantiation will raise an exception and fail whenever any of
     this conditions occur:
        * First argument is not a free variable.

        * Second argument functor is a class, but there is no usage
          relationship with it.

        * Second argument functor is not a class.

        * The given constructor is unknown.

        * The given constructor fails (notice that default
          constructor never fails).

     Objects may also be statically declared, refer to `instance_of/2'
     declaration.

     *Usage:* `new(InstanceVar,Constructor)'
        - _Description:_ Creates a new instance of the class
          specified by `Constructor' returning its identifier in
          `InstanceVar'

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `InstanceVar' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

          `Constructor' is a term whose functor matches a class name.
          (objects_rt:constructor/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `InstanceVar' is an unique term which identifies an object.
          (objects_rt:instance_id/1)


 -- PREDICATE: instance_of/2:
     This predicate is used to perform dynamic type checking. You may
     check whether a particular instance belongs to a particular
     class or related descendants.

     instance_of/2 is used to perform static semantic analisys over
     object oriented code constructions.

     By the use of instance_of/2 you may help to perform such
     analisys.

     *Usage 1:* `instance_of(Instance,Class)'
        - _Description:_ Test whether `Instance' was derived from any
          descendant of `Class', or that class itself

          (objects_rt:class_name/1)

     *Usage 2:* `instance_of(Instance,Class)'
        - _Description:_ Retrieves, on backtracking, the inheritance
          line of `Instance' commencing on the creation class (that
          specified on call to `new/2') and continuing on the rest of
          ascendant classes, if any.

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Class' is an atom denoting a class.
          (objects_rt:class_name/1)


 -- PREDICATE: derived_from/2:
     Test whether an object identifier was derived directly from a
     class, by the usage of `new/2' or a static instance declaration ( `instance_of/2').

     *Usage 1:* `derived_from(Instance,Class)'
        - _Description:_ Test derivation of `Instance' from `Class'

          (objects_rt:instance_id/1)

          `Class' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Class' is an atom denoting a class.
          (objects_rt:class_name/1)


 -- PREDICATE: interface/2:
     This predicate is used to ensure a given interface to be
     implemented by a given instance.

     *Usage 1:* `interface(Instance,Interface)'
        - _Description:_ Check whether `Instance' implements the
          given `Interface'.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Instance' is an unique term which identifies an object.
          (objects_rt:instance_id/1)

          `Interface' is an unique atom which identifies a public
          interface.   (objects_rt:interface_name/1)

          (objects_rt:instance_id/1)

          `Interfaces' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Interfaces' is an unique atom which identifies a public
          interface.   (objects_rt:interface_name/1)


 -- PREDICATE: instance_codes/2:
     Retrieves a character string representation from an object
     identifier and vice-versa.

     *Usage 1:* `instance_codes(Instance,String)'
        - _Description:_ Retrieves a `String' representation of given
          `Instance'.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Instance' is an unique term which identifies an object.
          (objects_rt:instance_id/1)

          `String' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `String' is a string (a list of character codes).
          (basic_props:string/1)

     *Usage 2:* `instance_codes(Instance,String)'
        - _Description:_ Reproduces an `Instance' from its `String'
          representation. Such an instance must be alive across the
          application: this predicate will fail whether the involved
          instance has been destroyed.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Instance' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

          `String' is a string (a list of character codes).
          (basic_props:string/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Instance' is an unique term which identifies an object.
          (objects_rt:instance_id/1)


 -- PREDICATE: destroy/1:
     As well as instances are created, they must be destroyed when no
     longer needed in order to release system resources.

     Unfortunately, current O'Ciao implementation does not support
     automatic instance destruction, so user must manually call
     _destroy/1_ in order to do so.

     The programmer *must ensure* that no other references to the
     involved object are left in memory when destroy/1 is called. If
     not, unexpected results may be obtained.

     *Usage:* `destroy(Instance)'

122.3 Known bugs and planned improvements (`objects_rt')
========================================================

   * Usage of objects from the `user' module does not work properly.
     It is better to use the `objects' package in a (proper) module.

   * Not really a bug: when loading code which declares static
     instances from the toplevel shell, predicate `use_module/1')
     will not work properly: those instances may be not correctly
     created, and predicates will fail whenever they are not supposed
     to do. This may be avoided by reloading again the involved
     module, but make sure it is modified and saved to disk before
     doing so.

   O'CIAO abstract interfaces are simple modules which declares
exported predicates with no implementation. The implementation itself
will be provided by some class using an `implements/1' declaration.

   O'CIAO classes may be also treated as interfaces just ignoring all
exported predicate implementation.

******************************

*Author(s):* Jose F. Morales, Manuel Carro.

   Ciao Prolog includes a high-level, flexible way to interface C and
Prolog, based on the use of assertions to declare what are the
expected types and modes of the arguments of a Prolog predicate, and
which C files contain the corresponding code. To this end, the user
provides:

   * A set of C files, or a precompiled shared library,

   * A Ciao Prolog module defining whith predicates are implemented
     in the C files and the types and modes of their arguments, and

   * an (optional) set of flags required for the compilation of the
     files.

   The Ciao Prolog compiler analyzes the Prolog code written by the
user and gathers this information in order to generate automatically
C "glue" code implementing the data translation between Prolog and C,
and to compile the C code into dynamically loadable C object files,
which are linked automatically when needed.

124.1 Declaration of Types
==========================

Each predicate implemented as a foreign C function must have
accompanying declarations in the Ciao Prolog associated file stating
the types and modes of the C function. A sample declaration for
`prolog_predicate' which is implemented as `foreign_function_name' is:

          :- true pred prolog_predicate(m1(Arg1), ... mN(ArgN)) ::
                       type1 * ... * typeN +
                       (foreign(foreign_function_name), returns(ArgR)).

where `m1', ..., `mN' and `type1', ..., `typeN' are respectively the
modes and types of the arguments. `foreign_function_name' is the name
of the C function implementing `prolog_predicate/N', and the result
of this function is unified with `ArgR', which must be one of `Arg1'
... `ArgN'.

   This notation can be simplified in several ways. If the name of
the foreign function is the same as the name of the Ciao Prolog
predicate, `foreign(foreign_function_name)' can be replaced by
`foreign/0'. `returns(ArgR)' specifies that the result of the
function corresponds to the `ArgR' argument of the Ciao Prolog
predicate. If the foreign function does not return anything (or if
its value is ignored), then `returns(ArgR)' must be removed. Note
that `returns' cannot be used without `foreign'. A simplified,
minimal form is thus:

          :- true pred prolog_predicate(m1(Arg1), ... mN(ArgN)) ::
                       type1 * ... * typeN + foreign.

124.2 Equivalence between Ciao Prolog and C types
=================================================

The automatic translation between Ciao Prolog and C types is defined
(at the moment) only for some simple but useful types. The
translation to be performed is solely defined by the types of the
arguments in the Ciao Prolog file (i.e., no inspection of the
corresponding C file is done). The names (and meaning) of the types
known for performing that translation are to be found in *note
Foreign Language Interface Properties::; they are also summarized
below (Prolog types are on the left, and the corresponding C types on
the right):

   * num <-> double

   * int <-> int

   * atm <-> char *

   * string <-> char * (with trailing zero)

   * byte_list <-> char * (a buffer of bytes, with associated length)

   * int_list <-> int * (a buffer of integers, with associated length)

   * double_list <-> double * (a buffer of doubles, with associated
     length)

   * address <-> void *

   Strings, atoms, and lists of bytes are passed to (and from) C as
dynamically (`ciao_malloc') created arrays of characters (bytes).
Those arrays are freed by Ciao Prolog upon return of the foreign
function unless the property `do_not_free/2' is specified (see
examples below). This caters for the case in which the C files save
in a private state (either by themselves, or by a library function
being called by them) the values passed on from Prolog. The type `byte_list/1'
requires an additional property, `size_of/2', to indicate which
argument represents its size.

   Empty lists of bytes and integers are converted into C `NULL'
pointers, and vice versa. Empty strings (`[]') and null atoms (") are
converted into zero-length, zero-ended C strings (_""_). C `NULL'
strings and empty buffers (i.e., buffers with zero length) are
transformed into the empty list or the null atom (`''').

   Most of the work is performed by the predicates in the *note
Foreign Language Interface Builder::, which can be called explicitly
by the user. Doing that is not usually needed, since the Ciao Prolog
Compiler takes care of building glue code files an of compiling and
linking whatever is necessary.

124.3 Equivalence between Ciao Prolog and C modes
=================================================

The (prefix) `+/1' ISO mode (or, equivalently, the in/1 mode) states
that the corresponding Prolog argument is ground at the time of the
call, and therefore it is an input argument in the C part; this
groundness is automatically checked upon entry. The (prefix) `-/1'
ISO mode (or, equivalently, the go/1 mode) states that Prolog expects
the C side to generate a (ground) value for that argument. Arguments
with output mode should appear in C functions as pointers to the
corresponding base type (as it is usual with C), i.e., an argument
which is an integer generated by the C file, declared as

     :- true pred get_int(go(ThisInt)) :: int + foreign

   or as

     :- true pred get_int(-ThisInt) :: int + foreign

   should appear in the C code as

     void get_int(int *thisint)
     {
             ....
     }

   Note the type of the (single) argument of the function. Besides,
the return value of a function can always be used as an output
argument, just by specifying to which Prolog arguments it
corresponds, using the `foreing/1' property. The examples below
illustrate this point, and the use of several assertions to guide the
compilation.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Custom access to Prolog from C,  Next: Examples,  Prev: Equivalence between Ciao Prolog and C modes,  Up: Foreign Language Interface

124.4 Custom access to Prolog from C
====================================

Automatic type conversions does not cover all the possible cases.
When the automatic type conversion is not enough (or if the user, for
any reason, does not want to go through the automatic conversion), it
is possible to instruct Ciao Prolog not to make implicit type
conversion. The strategy in that case is to pass the relevant
argument(s) with a special type (a `ciao_term') which can represent
any term which can be built in Prolog. Operations to construct,
traverse, and test this data abstraction from C are provided. The
prototypes of these operations are placed on the `"ciao_prolog.h"'
file, under the `include' subdirectory of the installation directory
(the Ciao Prolog compiler knowns where it has been installed, and
gives the C compiler the appropriate flags). This _non direct
correspondence_ mode is activated whenever a Ciao Prolog type unknown
to the foreign interface (i.e., none of these in *note Foreign
Language Interface Properties::) or the type `any_term' (which is
explicitly recognised by the foreign language interface) is found.
The latter is preferred, as it is much more informative, and external
tools, as the the CiaoPP preprocessor, can take advantage of them.

124.4.1 Term construction
-------------------------

All term construction primitives return an argument of type
`ciao_term', which is the result of constructing a term. All Ciao
Prolog terms can be built using the interface operations
`ciao_var()', `ciao_structure()', `ciao_integer()', and
`ciao_float()'. There are, however, variants and specialized versions
of these operations which can be freely intermixed. Using one version
or another is a matter of taste and convenience. We list below the
prototypes of the primitives in order of complexity.

   Throughout this section, *true*, when referred to a boolean value,
correspond to the integer value `1', and *false* correspond to the
integer value `0', as is customary in C boolean expressions. These
values also available as the (predefined) constants `ciao_true' and
`ciao_false', both of type `ciao_bool'.

   * `ciao_term ciao_var();'

     Returns a fresh, unbound variable.

   * `ciao_term ciao_integer(int i);'

     Creates a term, representing an integer from the Prolog point of
     view, from a C integer.

   * `ciao_term ciao_float(double i);'

     Creates a term, representing a floating point number, from a
     floating point number.

   * `ciao_term ciao_put_number_chars(char *number_string);'

     It converts `number_string' (which must a string representing a
     syntactically valid number) into a `ciao_term'.

   * `ciao_term ciao_atom(char *name);'

     Creates an atom whose printable name is given as a C string.

   * `ciao_term ciao_structure_a(char *name, int arity, ciao_term
     *args);'

     Creates a structure with name 'name' (i.e., the functor name ),
     arity 'arity' and the components of the array 'args' as
     arguments: `args[0]' will be the first argument, `args[1]' the
     second, and so on. The 'args' array itself is not needed after
     the term is created, and can thus be a variable local to a
     procedure. An atom can be represented as a 0-arity structure
     (with `ciao_structure(name, 0)'), and a list cell can be
     constructed using the '.'/2 structure name. The `_a' suffix
     stands for _array_.

   * `ciao_term ciao_structure(char *name, int arity, ...);'

     Similar to ciao_structure_a, but the C arguments after the arity
     are used to fill in the arguments of the structure.

   * `ciao_term ciao_list(ciao_term head, ciao_term tail);'

     Creates a list from a `head' and a `tail'. It is equivalent to
     `ciao_structure(".", 2, head, tail)'.

   * `ciao_term ciao_empty_list();'

     Creates an empty list. It is equivalent to `ciao_atom("[]")'.

   * `ciao_term ciao_listn_a(int len, ciao_term *args);'

     Creates a list with 'len' elements from the array `args'. The
     _nth_ element of the list (starting at 1) is `args[n-1]'
     (starting at zero).

   * `ciao_term ciao_listn(int length, ...);'

     Like `ciao_listn_a()', but the list elements appear explicitly
     as arguments in the call.

   * `ciao_term ciao_dlist_a(int len, ciao_term *args, ciao_term
     base);'

     Like `ciao_listn_a', but a difference list is created. `base'
     whill be used as the tail of the list, instead of the empty list.

   * `ciao_term ciao_dlist(int length, ...);'

     Similar to `ciao_dlist_a()' with a variable number of arguments.
     The last one is the tail of the list.

   * `ciao_term ciao_copy_term(ciao_term src_term);'

     Returns a new copy of the `term', with fresh variables (as
     `copy_term/2' does).

124.4.2 Testing the Type of a Term
----------------------------------

A `ciao_term' can contain _any_ Prolog term, and its implementation
is opaque to the C code. Therefore the only way to know reliably what
data is passed on is using explicit functions to test term types.
Below, `ciao_bool' is a type defined in `"ciao_prolog.h"' which can
take the values 1 (for *true*) and 0 (for *false*).

   * `ciao_bool ciao_is_variable(ciao_term term);'

     Returns true if `term' is currently an uninstantiated variable.

   * `ciao_bool ciao_is_number(ciao_term term);'

     Returns true if `term' is an integer (of any length) or a
     floating point number.

   * `ciao_bool ciao_is_integer(ciao_term term);'

     Returns true if `term' is instantiated to an integer.

   * `ciao_bool ciao_fits_in_int(ciao_term term);'

     Returns true if `term' is instantiated to an integer which can
     be stored in an `int', and false otherwise.

   * `ciao_bool ciao_is_atom(ciao_term atom);'

     Returns true if `term' is an atom.

   * `ciao_bool ciao_is_list(ciao_term term);'

     Returns true if `term' is a list (actually, a `cons' cell).

   * `ciao_bool ciao_is_empty_list(ciao_term term);'

     Returns true if `term' is the atom which represents the empty
     list (i.e., `[]').

   * `ciao_bool ciao_is_structure(ciao_term term);'

     Returns true if `term' is a structure of any arity. This
     includes atoms (i.e., structures of arity zero) and lists, but
     excludes variables and numbers.



File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Term navigation,  Next: Testing for Equality and Performing Unification,  Prev: Testing the Type of a Term,  Up: Custom access to Prolog from C

124.4.3 Term navigation
-----------------------

The functions below can be used to recover the value of a `ciao_term'
into C variables, or to inspect Prolog structures.

   * `int ciao_to_integer(ciao_term term); '

     Converts `term' to an integer. `ciao_is_integer(term)' must hold.

   * `ciao_bool ciao_to_integer_check(ciao_term term, int *result); '

     Checks whether `term' fits into the size of an integer. If so,
     true is returned and `*result' is unified with the integer
     `term' represents. Otherwise, false is returned and `*result' is
     not touched.

   * `double ciao_to_float(ciao_term term);'

     Converts `term' to a float value. `ciao_is_number(term)' must
     hold.

   * `char *ciao_get_number_chars(ciao_term term);'

     It converts `ciao_term' (which must be instantiated to a number)
     into a C string representing the number in the current radix.
     The string returned is a copy, which must (eventually) be
     explicitly deallocated by the user C code using the operation
     `ciao_free()'

   * `char *ciao_atom_name(ciao_term atom);'

     Returns the name of the atom. The returned string _is the one
     internally used by Ciao Prolog_, and should not be deallocated,
     changed or altered in any form. The advantage of using it is
     that it is fast, as no data copying is needed.

   * `char *ciao_atom_name_dup(ciao_term atom);'

     Obtains a *copy* of the name of the atom. The string can be
     modified, and the programmer has the responsibility of
     deallocating it after being used. Due to the copy, it is slower
     than calling `char *ciao_atom_name()'.

   * `ciao_term ciao_list_head(ciao_term term);'

     Extracts the head of the list `term'. Requires `term' to be a
     list.

   * `ciao_term ciao_list_tail(ciao_term term);'

     Extracts the tail of the list `term'. Requires `term' to be a
     list.

   * `char *ciao_structure_name(ciao_term term);'

     Extracts the name of the structure `term'. Requires `term' to be
     a structure.

   * `int ciao_structure_arity(ciao_term term);'

     Extracts the arity of the structure `term'.

     Requires `term' to be a structure.

   * `ciao_term ciao_structure_arg(ciao_term term, int n);'

     Extracts the _nth_ argument of the structure `term'. It behaves
     like `arg/3', so the first argument has index 1. Requires `term'
     to be a structure.

124.4.4 Testing for Equality and Performing Unification
-------------------------------------------------------

Variables of type `ciao_term' cannot be tested directly for equality:
they are (currently) implemented as a sort of pointers which may be
aliased (two different pointers may refer to the same object). The
interface provides helper functions for testing term equality and to
perform unification of terms.

   * `ciao_bool ciao_unify(ciao_term x, ciao_term y);'

     Performs the unification of the terms `x' and `y', and returns
     true if the unification was successful. This is equivalent to
     calling the (infix) Prolog predicate `=/2'. The bindings are
     trailed and undone on backtracking.

   * `ciao_bool ciao_equal(ciao_term x, ciao_term y);'

     Performs equality testing of terms, and returns true if the test
     was successful. This is equivalent to calling the (infix) Prolog
     predicate `==/2'. Equality testing does not modify the terms
     compared.

124.4.5 Raising Exceptions
--------------------------

The following functions offers a way of throwing exceptions from C
that can be caught in Prolog with `catch/3'. The term that reaches
Prolog is exactly the same which was thrown by C. The execution flow
is broken at the point where `ciao_raise_exception()' is executed,
and it returns to Prolog.

   * `void ciao_raise_exception(ciao_term ball);'

     Raises an exception an throws the term `ball'.

124.4.6 Creating and disposing of memory chunks
-----------------------------------------------

Memory to be used solely by the user C code can be reserved/disposed
of using, e.g., the well-known `malloc()'/`free()' functions (or
whatever other functions the user may have available). However,
memory explicitly allocated by Ciao Prolog and passed to C code, or
allocated by C code and passed on to Ciao Prolog (and subject to
garbage collection by it) should be allotted and freed (when
necessary) by using the functions:

   * `void *ciao_malloc(int size);'

   * `void ciao_free(void *pointer);'


whose behavior is similar to `malloc()'/`free()', but which will
cooordinate properly with Ciao Prolog's internal memory management.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Calling Prolog from C,  Prev: Creating and disposing of memory chunks,  Up: Custom access to Prolog from C

124.4.7 Calling Prolog from C
-----------------------------

It is also possible to make arbitraty calls to Prolog predicates from
C. There are two basic ways of make a query, depending on whether
only one solution is needed (or if the predicate to be called is
known to generate only one solution), or if several solutions are
required.

   When only one solution is needed `ciao_commit_call' obtains it
(the solution obtained will obviously be the first one) and discards
the resources used for finding it:

   * `ciao_bool ciao_commit_call(char *name, int arity, ...);'

     Makes a call to a predicate and returns true or false depending
     on whether the query has succedeed or not. In case of success,
     the (possibly) instantiated variables are reachable from C.

   * `ciao_bool ciao_commit_call_term(ciao_term goal);'

     Like `ciao_commit_call()' but uses the previously built term
     `goal' as goal.


   If more than one solution is needed, it is necessary to use the
`ciao_query' operations. A consult begins with a `ciao_query_begin'
which returns a `ciao_query' object. Whenever an additional solution
is required, the `ciao_query_next' function can be called. The query
ends by calling `ciao_query_end' and all pending search branches are
pruned.

   * `ciao_query *ciao_query_begin(char *name, int arity, ...);'

     The predicate with the given name, arity and arguments (similar
     to the `ciao_structure()' operation) is transformed into a
     `ciao_query' object which can be used to make the actual query.

   * `ciao_query *ciao_query_begin_term(ciao_term goal);'

     Like ciao_query_begin but using the term `goal' instead.

   * `ciao_bool ciao_query_ok(ciao_query *query);'

     Determines whether the query may have pending solutions. A false
     return value means that there are no more solutions; a true
     return value means that there are more possible solutions.

   * `void ciao_query_next(ciao_query *query);'

     Ask for a new solution.

124.5.1 Mathematical functions
------------------------------

In this example, the standard mathematical library is accessed to
provide the _sin_, _cos_, and _fabs_ functions. Note that the library
is specified simply as

     :- use_foreign_library([m]).

   The foreign interface adds the `-lm' at compile time. Note also
how some additional options are added to optimize the compiled code
(only glue code, in this case) and mathematics (only in the case of
Linux in an Intel processor).

File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Addresses and C pointers,  Next: Lists of bytes and buffers,  Prev: Mathematical functions,  Up: Examples

124.5.2 Addresses and C pointers
--------------------------------

The `address' type designates any pointer, and provides a means to
deal with C pointers in Prolog without interpreting them whatsoever.
The C source file which implements the operations accessed from
Prolog is declared with the

     :- use_foreign_source(objects_c).

   directive.

   *File* _objects.pl_:

     :- module(objects, [object/2, show_object/1], [foreign_interface]).

     :- true pred object(in(N),go(Object)) ::
             int * address + (foreign,returns(Object)).

     :- true pred show_object(in(Object)) ::
             address + foreign.

     :- use_foreign_source(objects_c).
     :- extra_compiler_opts('-O2').

   *File* _objects_c.c_:

     struct object {
       char *name;
       char *colour;
     };

     #define OBJECTS 3

     struct object objects[OBJECTS] =
     { {"ring","golden"},
       {"table","brown"},
       {"bottle","green"} };

     struct object *object(int n) {
       return &objects[n % OBJECTS];
     }

     void show_object(struct object *o) {

     }

124.5.3 Lists of bytes and buffers
----------------------------------

A list of bytes (c.f., a list of ints) corresponds to a byte buffer
in C. The length of the buffer is associated to that of the list
using the property `size_of/2'. The returned buffer *is freed by Ciao
Prolog* upon its recepction, unless the `do_not_free/1' property is
specified (see later). Conversely, a list of natural numbers in the
range 0 to 255 can be passed to C as a buffer.

124.5.5 Strings and atoms
-------------------------

A C string can be seen as a buffer whose end is denoted by the
trailing zero, and therefore stating its length is not needed. Two
translations are possible into Ciao Prolog: as a Prolog string (list
of bytes, with no trailing zero) and as an atom. These are selected
automatically just by choosing the corresponding type (look at the
examples below).

   Note how the `do_not_free/1' property is specified in the `a_string/1'
predicate: the string returned by C is static, and therefore it
should not be freed by Prolog.

Unbound length integers (and, in general, any number) can be

possible (checking whether numbers fit into a machine int or not),
and being lazy and simpler -and probably slower.

126 Utilities for on-demand compilation of foreign files
********************************************************

*Author(s):* Manuel Carro, Jose F. Morales.

   This module provides two predicates which give the user
information regarding how to compile external (C) files in order to
link them with the Ciao Prolog engine at runtime.

   These predicates are not intended to be called directly by the
end-user. Instead, a tool or module whose aim is generating
dynamically loadable files from source files should use the
predicates in this file in order to find out what are the proper
compiler and linker to use, and which options must be passed to them
in the current architecture.

 -- PREDICATE: generate_js_menu/1:
     Internal Info. Short description and general ideas about how the
     JS menu is generated.

     The current model for the JS menu is an array of `menuq' (object
     in JS).

          var assert_rtcheck = menus.length ;
          var v_assert_rtcheck ;
          menus[ menus.length ] = new menuq(
          	"assert_rtcheck",
                  "Perform Run-Time Checks",
                  "none,pred,pp_assrt,pp_code",
                  "none",
                  '((v_menu_level == "expert") &&
                    (v_inter_all == "check_assertions"))' ) ;

     A variable with the same name as the _flag name_ is created with
     the value of the index of the menu in the array. Another
     variable with 'v_' (v = value) indicates the value (of the flag)
     choosed by the user in the combo-boxes that appear on the
     webpage (note you should not read this if you have not seen the
     webpage working). The object `menuq' holds several things: the
     flag name (to find out the index in the array in some JS
     functions), the title, the options (notice there is no space in
     the options, this is important!), default option and the guard.

     All the problem here is to generate the (JS) guard, because the
     rest of information is the same as in `menu_opt/6'. What code
     does is to execute the guard in prolog, and obtain a list of the
     form [flag=value,flag2=value2...]. Aditionally an element of the
     list can be another list, which indicates that the join operator
     (&& or ||) is swaped. For example: [a=1,[b=2,c=3],d=4] will be
     translated in JS like ((a==1)&&((b==2)||(c==3))&&(d==4)).

     Prolog Guards (the ones in menu_opt) have been rewritten in
     order to do not generate free variables, i.e., they are finite
     guards now. So calling them with a variable in its first
     argument, we get the list like the named in the previous
     paragraph.

     % Unfortunately, the current CiaoPP menu does not have all
     information % itself to concatenate several menus, i.e., when
     asking which kind of % action the user desire, depending on the
     answer one path or another % one is taken. Who decide which
     path? 'auto_inteface' does. We do have % to take this into
     account, because generating the assertions of a % "subpath" will
     produce the activation of it without permision of the % father
     (the menu which launch it).

     Also, we have to keep in mind that menu has several submenus (or
     branches) defined and ones connect with others. For example, the
     menu

          all, 'Select Menu Level'   # menu_level - naive.
          all, 'Select Action Group' # inter_all  - analyze :: all_menu_branch.

          check(1), 'Perform Compile-Time Checks' # assert_ctcheck - on.
          ...

          ana     , 'Select Aliasing-Mode Analysis' # modes - shfr <- true.

     defines 3 menus: `all', `check(1)', and `ana'. It usually
     happends that one menu invoques (connect or continue) with
     another menu (then it is a submenu or a branch). When generating
     the guards we have to add additional restrictions to the guards
     in order to make submenus do not appear in the incorrect moment.
     For example, `check(1)' menu will be only active if `menu_level
     = expert' and `inter_all=check_assertions' (more on this come
     later). How are several menus connected between each other? The
     process of connecting the menus is post-processing the selected
     flags (options) via post hook (the one defined after :: field).
     The post-processing hook only have to add the element
     `ask_menu(Branch,Level)' or `ask_menu(Branch)' to the selected
     flag list (the argument of the hook). So let us say that when
     calling all_menu_branch( X , Y ) we get:

          ?- all_menu_branch(A,B).

          A = [inter_all=optimize,menu_level=naive|_A],
          B = [ask_menu(opt,0),inter_all=optimize,menu_level=naive|_A] ? ;

          A = [inter_all=optimize,menu_level=expert|_A],
          B = [ask_menu(opt,1),inter_all=optimize,menu_level=expert|_A] ? ;

          A = [inter_all=analyze,menu_level=naive|_A],
          B = [ask_menu(ana,0),inter_all=analyze,menu_level=naive|_A] ? ;

          A = [inter_all=analyze,menu_level=expert|_A],
          B = [ask_menu(ana,1),inter_all=analyze,menu_level=expert|_A] ? ;

          A = [inter_all=check_assertions,menu_level=naive|_A],
          B = [ask_menu(check,0),inter_all=check_assertions,menu_level=naive|_A] ? ;

          A = [inter_all=check_assertions,menu_level=expert|_A],
          B = [ask_menu(check,1),inter_all=check_assertions,menu_level=expert|_A] ? ;

          A = [inter_all=check_certificate,menu_level=_B|_A],
          B = [inter_all=check_certificate,menu_level=_B|_A] ? ;

          A = [inter_all=optimize,_A,menu_level=naive|_B],
          B = [ask_menu(opt,0),inter_all=optimize,_A,menu_level=naive|_B] ?

     Notice that the last option contains free variables in the list
     (not taking the tail into account). That is the indicator for us
     to stop searching for more solutions. Additionally, we can have
     more complex things like:

          ?- opt_menu_branch(A,B).

          A = [menu_level=naive,inter_optimize=_A|_B],
          B = [ask_menu(_A,0),menu_level=naive,inter_optimize=_A|_B] ? ;

          A = [menu_level=expert,inter_optimize=_A|_B],
          B = [ask_menu(_A,1),menu_level=expert,inter_optimize=_A|_B] ? ;

          A = [menu_level=naive,_B,inter_optimize=_A|_C],
          B = [ask_menu(_A,0),menu_level=naive,_B,inter_optimize=_A|_C] ?

     In this situation, the menu that will be asked will depend on
     the value of the flag `inter_optimize', so we will have to
     generate as many ask_menu as possible values the flag has. The
     predicate `generate_menu_path/2' solves all this problem: for a
     given flag, it looks up to find out the guard composed by flags
     that will activate the flag. % This predicate also consider the
     problem of menu aliasing, % i.e., the option optimize in
     inter_ana menu launch opt menu, so % optimize is an alias for
     opt or vice-versa. For example, for the given flag
     `ass_not_stat_eval', the path is: [v_menu_level=expert,
     v_inter_all=check_assertions], that means that `menu_level' flag
     has to have the value "expert" and the `inter_all' flag has to
     have the value "check_assertions" (note that menu_level and
     inter_all defines two menu branches). If we would execute only
     the precondition we would get: [v_assert_ctcheck=on].

     There are % two one limitations imposed to the JS menu. % The
     menu level indicated by `menu_level' flag, is hirewired. The %
     other limitation is more serious. All flags values in the JS
     menu are mapped into one set of flags. In other words, changing
     a value of a shared flag by two menu branch will be reflected on
     the other branch. For example, changing type analysis in
     `analyze' menu branch, will modify the value of the same flag in
     `check assertions' branch.

     The last point to name is about generated JS guards. This world
     is not fair, and sometimes happends things you just do not
     expect. Here is one of those things. When calling the Prolog
     guards with the list of current selected values, the cases that
     can occur are much less than when seeing all the possible
     combinations. Something like (a=true||a=1)&&(b=2), in Prolog
     guard execution (with instantiated things) will mean: the
     selected options are not nil, and a=1 and b=2, or in other
     words: (a==1)&&(b==2). But in JS, unfortunately means: b=2.
     Nowadays, this problem is solved by `clean_imperative_guard/2'
     which tries to remove all stupid `true' conditions, but I am
     sure Murphy is listening to me now and he started to create an
     user to make the call `clean_imperative_guard/2' generates wrong
     answer.

 -- PREDICATE: menu_opt/6:
     The predicate is _multifile_.

     *Usage 1:*
     `menu_opt(Menu,Flag,Text,Guard,BeforePrinting,SelectedHook)'
        - _Description:_ `Menu' is a term that specifies the menu
          name. It can be an atom or just a predicate of arity 1,
          where the 1st argument indicates the menu level (i.e.,
          ana(1) is the level 1 of 'ana' menu). `Flag' is the flag
          that will be asked.

          `Text' is the test that will be printed when asking the
          `Flag'.

          `Guard' is a predicate of arity 1 that is invoked to see if
          the flag should be asked. The argument is the selected menu
          options till moment in the way: [flag1=value1,
          flag2=value2, ...].

          `BeforePrinting' is a predicate of arity 0, that is invoked
          whenever the menu option has been selected the validator
          menu options chooser.

          `SelectedHook' is a predicate of arity 2, that is invoked
          whenever the flag has been selected by the user. The 1st
          argument are the current selected values, including the
          current flag, and in the 2nd argument the possible modified
          list is expected.

          In summary, if `Guard' holds, then `BeforePrinting' is
          executed (no action is taken whether it fails or not), and
          after the user has types the option `SelectedHook' is
          invoked.

     *Usage:* `hook_menu_flag_values(Menu,Flag,Values)'
        - _Description:_ It is a hook. It is invoked whenever a menu
          question is printed. `Values' is a term which specifies the
          possible values. If `Values' is alist(List) -atom list-,
          then menu will check if the typed value by user belongs to
          List. If `Values' is a term ask(T,Flag), the menu will
          invoke `hook_menu_check_flag_value/3' hook to check if
          introduced value is valid.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Menu' is currently instantiated to an atom.
          (term_typing:atom/1)

          `Flag' is currently instantiated to an atom.
          (term_typing:atom/1)

          `Values' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          Flag values  (menu_generator:menu_flag_values/1)


 -- PREDICATE: hook_menu_check_flag_value/3:
     The predicate is _multifile_.

     *Usage:* `hook_menu_check_flag_value(M,F,V)'
        - _Description:_ It is a hook. It is invoked whenever the
          menu needs to check whether the answer introduced for the
          menu `M' is correct. This happens when `hook_menu_flag_values/3'
          returns in its second argument something different than
          alist(_).


 -- PREDICATE: hook_menu_flag_help/3:
     The predicate is _multifile_.

     *Usage:* `hook_menu_flag_help(M,F,H)'
        - _Description:_ It is a hook. It is invoked whenever the
          user ask for a help description, `H', of the flag `F' in
          the menu `M'.


 -- PREDICATE: hook_menu_default_option/3:
     The predicate is _multifile_.

     *Usage:* `hook_menu_default_option(M,F,D)'
        - _Description:_ It is a hook. It is invoked whenever the
          menu needs to offer a default option to the user in the
          menu `M' and it has not been neither introduced before nor
          specified by `menu_default/3'.

130 Interface to daVinci
************************

*Author(s):* Francisco Bueno.

   This library allows connecting a Ciao Prolog application with
daVinci V2.X.

   The communication is based on a two-way channel: after daVinci is
started, messages are sent in to it and read in from it on demand by
different Prolog predicates. Messages are sent via writing the term
as text; messages are received by reading text and returning an atom.
Commands sent and answers received are treated as terms from the
Prolog side, since for daVinci they are text but have term syntax;
the only difficulty lies in strings, for which special Prolog syntax
is provided.

   See accompanying file `library(davinci(commands))' for examples on
the use of this library.

   daVinci is developed by U. of Bremen, Germany.

130.3 Documentation on internals (`davinci')
============================================

 -- PROPERTY: davinci_command/1:
     Syntactically, a command is a term. Semantically, it has to
     correspond to a command understood by daVinci. Two terms are
     interpreted in a special way: `string/1' and `text/1':
     `string(Term)' is given to daVinci as `"Term"'; `text(List)' is
     given as `"Term1 Term2 ...Term "' for each `Term' in `List'. If
     your term has functors `string/1' and `text/1' that you don't
     want to be interpreted this way, use it twice, i.e.,
     `string(string(Term))' is given to daVinci as `string(Term')'
     where `Term'' is the interpretation of `Term'.


 -- PROPERTY: ugraph/1:
     `ugraph(Graph)'

     `Graph' is a term which denotes an ugraph as in
     `library(ugraphs)'. Vertices of the form `node/2' are
     interpreted in a special way: `node(Term,List)' is interpreted
     as a vertex `Term' with attributes `List'. `List' is a list of
     terms conforming the syntax of `davinci_put/1' and corresponding
     to daVinci's graph nodes attributes. If your vertex has functor
     `node/2' and you don't want it to be interpreted this way, use
     it twice, i.e., `node(node(T1,T2),[])' is given to daVinci as
     vertex `node(T1,T2)'. A vertex is used both as label and name of
     daVinci's graph node. daVinci's graph edges have label `V1-V2'
     where `V1' is the source and `V2' the sink of the edge. There is
     no support for multiple edges between the same two vertices.


 -- PROPERTY: lgraph/1:
     `lgraph(Graph)'

     `Graph' is a term which denotes a wgraph as in
     `library(wgraphs)', except that the weights are labels, i.e.,
     they do not need to be integers. Vertices of the form `node/2'
     are interpreted in a special way. Edge labels are converted into
     special intermediate vertices. Duplicated labels are solved by
     adding dummy atoms `'''. There is no support for multiple edges
     between the same two vertices.

131 The Tcl/Tk interface
************************

*Author(s):* Montse Iglesias Urraca, The CLIP Group.

   The `tcltk' library package is a bidirectional interface to the
_Tcl_ language and the _Tk_ toolkit. Tcl is an interpreted scripting
language with many extension packages, particularly the graphical
interface toolkit, Tk. The interaction between both languages is
expressed in terms of an interface between the Tcl/Tk process and the
Prolog process. This approach allows the development of mixed
applications where both sides, Tcl/Tk and Prolog, can be combined in
order to exploit their respective capabilities.

   This library uses two sockets to connect both the Tcl and the
Prolog processes: _event_socket_ and _term_socket_. There are also
two Tcl global variables: _prolog_variables_ and _terms_. The value
of any of the bound variables in a goal will be stored in the array
`prolog_variables' with the variable name as index. _Terms_ is the
string which contains the printed representation of prolog _terms_.

*Prolog to Tcl*

   The Tcl/Tk side waits for requests from the Prolog side, and
executes the Tcl/Tk code received. Also, the Tcl/Tk side handles the
events and exceptions which may be raised on its side, passing on
control to the Prolog side in case it is necessary.

   To use Tcl, you must create a _Tcl interpreter_ object and send
commands to it. A _Tcl_ command is specified as follows:

           Command         --> Atom  { other than [] }
                             | Number
                             | chars(PrologString)
                             | write(Term)
                             | format(Fmt,Args)
                             | dq(Command)
                             | br(Command)
                             | sqb(Command)
                             | min(Command)
                             | ListOfCommands
           ListOfCommands  --> []
                             |[Command|ListOfCommands]

   where:

`Atom'
     denotes the printed representation of the atom.

`Number'
     denotes their printed representations.

`chars(PrologString)'
     denotes the string represented by _PrologString_ (a list of
     character codes).

`write(Term)'
     denotes the string that is printed by the corresponding built-in
     predicate.

`format(Term)'
     denotes the string that is printed by the corresponding built-in
     predicate.

`dq(Command)'
     denotes the string specified by _Command_, enclosed in double
     quotes.

`br(Command)'
     denotes the string specified by _Command_, enclosed in braces.

`sqb(Command)'
     denotes the string specified by _Command_, enclosed in square
     brackets.

`min(Command)'
     denotes the string specified by _Command_, immediately preceded
     by a hyphen.

`ListOfCommands'
     denotes the strings denoted by each element, separated by spaces.


   The predicates to use Tcl from Prolog are `tcl_new/1', `tcl_delete/1', `tcl_eval/3',
and `tcl_event/3'.

An example of use with Prolog as master and Tcl as slave, consisting
of a GUI to a program which calculates the factorial of a number:


     :- use_module(library(tcltk)).

     go :-
             tcl_new(X),
             tcl_eval(X,[button,'.b',min(text),dq('Compute!')],_),
             tcl_eval(X,[button,'.c','-text',dq('Quit')],_),
             tcl_eval(X,[entry,'.e1',min(textvariable),'inputval'],_),
             tcl_eval(X,[label,'.l1',min(text),dq('The factorial of ')],_),
             tcl_eval(X,[pack, '.l1','.e1'],_),
             tcl_eval(X,[entry,'.e2',min(textvariable),'outputval'],_),
             tcl_eval(X,[label,'.l2',min(text),dq('is  ')],_),
             tcl_eval(X,[pack, '.l2','.e2'],_),
             tcl_eval(X,[pack,'.b','.c',min(side),'left'],_),
             tcl_eval(X,[bind,'.b','<ButtonPress-1>',
                     br([set,'inputval','$inputval','\n',
                     prolog_one_event,
                     dq(write(execute(tk_test_aux:factorial('$inputval', 'Outputval')))),
                     '\n',
                     set, 'outputval','$prolog_variables(Outputval)'])],
                     _),
             tcl_eval(X,[bind,'.c','<ButtonPress-1>',
                     br([prolog_one_event,
                     dq(write(execute(exit_tk_event_loop)))])],
                     _),
             tk_event_loop(X).

*Tcl to Prolog*

   This is the usual way to build a GUI application. The slave,
Prolog, behaves as a server that fulfills eventual requests from the
master side, Tcl. At some point, during the user interaction with the
GUI, an action may take place that triggers the execution of some
procedure on the slave side (a form submit, for example). Thus, the
slave is invoked, performs a service, and returns the result to the
GUI through the socket connection.

   This library includes two main specific Tcl commands:

`prolog' _Goal_
     _Goal_ is a string containing the printed representation of a
     Prolog goal. The goal will be called in the user module unless
     it is prefixed with another module name. The call is always
     deterministic and its can be either of the following:

    _1_, in case of success
          The value of any of the variables in the goal that is bound
          to a term will be returned to Tcl in the array
          prolog_variables with the variable name as index.

    _0_, if the execution fails
          The Prolog exception Tcl exception is raised. The error
          message will be "Prolog Exception: " appended with a string
          representation of such exception.


`prolog_event' _Term_
     Adds the new _term_ to the _terms_ queue. These can be later
     retrieved through predicates `tcl_event/3' and `tk_next_event/2'.


   Additionally, seven extra Tcl commands are defined.

`prolog_delete_event'
     Deletes the first _term_ of the _terms_ queue.

`prolog_list_events'
     Sends all the _terms_ of the _terms_ queue through the
     _event_socket_. The last element is _end_of_event_list_.

`prolog_cmd' _Command_
     Receives as an argument the Tcl/Tk code, evaluates it and
     returns through the _term_socket_ the term _tcl_error_ in case
     of error or the term _tcl_result_ with the result of the command
     executed. If the command is _prolog_, upon return, the goal run
     on the prolog side is received. In order to get the value of the
     variables, predicates are compared using the _unify_term_
     command. Returns 0 when the sript runs without errors, and 1 if
     there is an error.

`prolog_one_event' _Term_
     Receives as an argument the _term_ associated to one of the Tk
     events. Sends the _term_ through the _event_socket_ and waits
     for its unification. Then _unify_term_ command is called to
     update the _prolog_variables_ array.

`prolog_thread_event' _Term_
     Receives as an argument the _term_ associated to one of the Tk
     events. Sends the _term_ through the _event_socket_ and waits
     for its unification. Then _unify_term_ command is called to
     update the _prolog_variables_ array. In this case the
     _term_socket_ is non blocking.

`convert_variables' _String_
     Its argument is a string containing symbols that can not be sent
     through the sockets. This procedure deletes them from the input
     string and returns the new string.

`unify_term' _Term1_ _Term2_
     Unifies _Term1_ and _Term2_ and updates the the
     _prolog_variables_ array.


   The predicates to use Prolog from Tcl are `tk_event_loop/1', `tk_main_loop/1', `tk_new/2',
and `tk_next_event/2'.

An example of use with Tcl as master and Prolog as slave,
implementing the well known "Hello, world!" dummy program (more can
be seen in directory examples):

   Prolog side:


     :- use_module(library(tcltk)).
     :- use_package(classic).

     hello('Hello, world!').

     go :-
             tk_new([name('Simple')], Tcl),
             tcl_eval(Tcl, 'source simple.tcl', _),
             tk_main_loop(Tcl),
             tcl_delete(Tcl).

   Tcl side (simple.tcl):


     label .l -textvariable tvar
     button .b -text "Go!" -command {run}
     pack .l .b -side top

     proc run {} {

         global prolog_variables
         global tvar

         prolog hello(X)
         set tvar $prolog_variables(X)
     }

        - _Description:_ Waits for an event and executes the goal
          associated to it. Events are stored from Tcl with the
          _prolog_ command. The unified term is sent to the Tcl
          interpreter in order to obtain the value of the tcl array
          of _prolog_variables_. If the term received does not have
          the form `execute(Goal)', the predicate silently exits. If
          the execution of `Goal' raises a Prolog error, the
          interpreter is deleted and an error message is given.

        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `TclInterpreter' is a reference to a _Tcl_ interpreter.
          (tcltk:tclInterpreter/1)

          creates the main window of a Tk application.`Options' is a
          list of optional elements according to:

         `name(+ApplicationName)'
               Sets the Tk main window title to `ApplicationName'. It
               is also used for communicating between Tcl/Tk
               applications via the Tcl _send_ command. Default name
               is an empty string.

         `display(+Display)'
               Gives the name of the screen on which to create the
               main window. Default is normally determined by the
               `DISPLAY' environment variable.

         `file'
               Opens the sript `file'. Commands will not be read from
               standard input and the execution returns back to
               Prolog only after all windows (and the interpreter)
               have been deleted.

132 Low level interface library to Tcl/Tk
*****************************************

*Author(s):* Montse Iglesias Urraca.

   The `tcltk_low_level' library defines the low level interface used
by the `tcltk' library. Essentially it includes all the code related
directly to the handling of sockets and processes. This library
should normally not be used directly by user programs, which use `tcltk'
instead. On the other hand in some cases it may be useful to
undertand how this library works in order to understand possible
problems in programs that use the `tcltk' library.

**************************************

*Author(s):* Daniel Cabeza, Manuel Hermenegildo.

   This package implements the PiLLoW library [CHV96a]. The following
three chapters document, respectively, the predicates for
HTML/XML/CGI programming, the predicate for HTTP conectivity, and the
types used in the definition of the predicates (key for fully
understanding the other predicates). You can find a paper and some
additional information in the `library/pillow/doc' directory of the
distribution, and in the WWW at
`http://clip.dia.fi.upm.es/Software/pillow/pillow.html'. There is
also a _PiLLoW on-line tutorial_ (slides) at
`http://clip.dia.fi.upm.es/logalg/slides/C_pillow/C_pillow.html'
which illustrates the basic features and provides a number of
examples of PiLLoW use.

     and unifying `Dict' with a dictionary of those variables (an
     incomplete list of _name_`='_Var_ pairs). An HTML template is
     standard HTML code, but in which "slots" can be defined and
     given an identifier. These slots represent parts of the HTML
     code in which other HTML code can be inserted, and are
     represented in the HTML-term as free variables. There are two
     kinds of variables in templates:
        * Variables representing page contents. A variable with name
          _name_ is defined with the special tag `<V>'_name_`</V>'.

        * Variables representing tag attributes. They occur as an
          attribute or an attribute value starting with `_', followed
          by its name, which must be formed by alphabetic characters.


     As an example, suposse the following HTML template:
          <html>
          <body bgcolor=_bgcolor>
          <v>content</v>
          </body>
          </html>
     The following query in the Ciao toplevel shows how the template
     is parsed, and the dictionary returned:
          ?- file_to_string('template.html',_S), html_template(_S,Terms,Dict).

          Dict = [bgcolor=_A,content=_B|_],
          Terms = [env(html,[],["
          ",env(body,[bgcolor=_A],["
          ",_B,"
          "]),"
          "]),"
          "] ?

          yes
     If a dictionary with values is supplied at call time, then
     variables are unified accordingly inside the template:
          ?- file_to_string('template.html',_S),
             html_template(_S,Terms,[content=b("hello world!"),bgcolor="white"]).

          Terms = [env(html,[],["
          ",env(body,[bgcolor="white"],["
          ",b("hello world!"),"
          "]),"
          "]),"
          "] ?

          yes

     *Usage:*

          `Terms' is a term representing HTML code in canonical form.
          (pillow_types:canonic_html_term/1)

          `Dict' is a list.   (basic_props:list/1)

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Chars' is a string (a list of character codes).
          (basic_props:string/1)

        - _The following properties hold upon exit:_

          `Terms' is a term representing HTML code in canonical form.
          (pillow_types:canonic_html_term/1)

        - _Description:_ Outputs error `Error' as a standard HTML
          page.


 -- PREDICATE: get_form_input/1:
     `get_form_input(Dict)'

     Translates input from the form (with either the POST or GET
     methods, and even with CONTENT_TYPE multipart/form-data) to a
     dictionary `Dict' of _attribute_=_value_ pairs. If the flag
     `raw_form_values' is `off' (which is the default state), it
     translates empty values (which indicate only the presence of an
     attribute) to the atom `'$empty'', values with more than one
     line (from text areas or files) to a list of lines as strings,
     the rest to atoms or numbers (using `name/2'). If the flag `on',
     it gives all values as atoms, without translations.

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Dict' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

        - _The following properties hold upon exit:_

          `Dict' is a dictionary of values of the attributes of a
          form. It is a list of `form_assignment'
          (pillow_types:form_dict/1)


 -- PREDICATE: get_form_value/3:
     `get_form_value(Dict,Var,Val)'

     Unifies `Val' with the value for attribute `Var' in dictionary
     `Dict'. Does not fail: value is `''' if not found (this
     simplifies the programming of form handlers when they can be
     accessed directly).

     *Usage:*
        - _Calls should, and exit will be compatible with:_

          `Val' is a value of an attribute of a form.

          linefeeds).


 -- PREDICATE: form_default/3:
     *Usage:* `form_default(Val,Default,NewVal)'
        - _Description:_ Useful when a form is only partially filled,
          or when the executable can be invoked either by a link or
          by a form, to set form defaults. If the value of `Val' is
          empty then `NewVal'=`Default', else `NewVal'=`Val'.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Val' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `Default' is currently a term which is not a free variable.
          (term_typing:nonvar/1)

137.1 Introduction to persistent predicates
===========================================

This library implements a _generic persistent predicate database_.
The basic notion implemented by the library is that of a persistent
predicate. The persistent predicate concept provides a simple, yet
powerful generic persistent data access method [CHGT98,Par97]. A
persistent predicate is a special kind of dynamic, data predicate
that "resides" in some persistent medium (such as a set of files, a
database, etc.) that is typically external to the program using such
predicates. The main effect is that any changes made to a persistent
predicate from a program "survive" across executions. I.e., if the
program is halted and restarted the predicate that the new process
sees is in precisely the same state as it was when the old process
was halted (provided no change was made in the meantime to the
storage by other processes or the user).

   Persistent predicates appear to a program as ordinary predicates,
and calls to these predicates can appear in clause bodies in the
usual way. However, the definitions of these predicates do not appear
in the program. Instead, the library maintains automatically the
definitions of predicates which have been declared as persistent in
the persistent storage.

   Updates to persistent predicates can be made using enhanced
versions of `asserta_fact/1', `assertz_fact/1' and `retract_fact/1'.
The library makes sure that each update is a transactional update, in
the sense that if the update terminates, then the permanent storage
has definitely been modified. For example, if the program making the
updates is halted just after the update and then restarted, then the
updated state of the predicate will be seen. This provides security
against possible data loss due to, for example, a system crash. Also,
due to the atomicity of the transactions, persistent predicates allow concurrent
updates from several programs.

137.2 Persistent predicates, files, and relational databases
============================================================

The concept of persistent predicates provided by this library
essentially implements a light-weight, simple, and at the same time
powerful form of relational database (a deductive database), and
which is standalone, in the sense that it does not require external
support, other than the file management capabilities provided by the
operating system. This is due to the fact that the persistent
predicates are in fact stored in one or more auxiliary files below a
given directory.

   This type of database is specially useful when building small to
medium-sized standalone applications in Prolog which require
persistent storage. In many cases it provides a much easier way of
implementing such storage than using files under direct program
control. For example, interactive applications can use persistent
predicates to represent their internal state in a way that is close
to the application. The persistence of such predicates then allows
automatically restoring the state to that at the end of a previous
session. Using persistent predicates amounts to simply declaring some
predicates as such and eliminates having to worry about opening
files, closing them, recovering from system crashes, etc.

   In other cases, however, it may be convenient to use a relational
database as persistent storage. This may be the case, for example,
when the data already resides in such a database (where it is perhaps
accessed also by other applications) or the volume of data is very
large.  `persdb_sql' [CCG98] is a companion library which implements
the same notion of persistent predicates used herein, but keeping the
storage in a relational database. This provides a very natural and
transparent way to access SQL database relations from a Prolog
program. In that library, facilities are also provided for reflecting
more complex _views_ of the database relations as predicates. Such
views can be constructed as conjunctions, disjunctions, projections,
etc. of database relations, and may include SQL-like aggregation
operations.

   A nice characteristic of the notion of persistent predicates used
in both of these libraries is that it abstracts away how the
predicate is actually stored. Thus, a program can use persistent
predicates stored in files or in external relational databases
interchangeably, and the type of storage used for a given predicate
can be changed without having to modify the program (except for
replacing the corresponding `persistent/2' declarations).

   An example application of the `persdb' and `persdb_sql' libraries
(and also the `pillow' library [CH97]), is `WebDB' [GCH98].  `WebDB'
is a generic, highly customizable _deductive database engine_ with an
_html interface_.  `WebDB' allows creating and maintaining
Prolog-based databases as well as relational databases (residing in
conventional relational database engines) using any standard WWW
browser.

137.3 Using file-based persistent predicates
============================================

Persistent predicates can be declared statically, using `persistent/2'
declarations (which is the preferred method, when possible), or
dynamically via calls to `make_persistent/2'. Currently, persistent
predicates may only contain facts, i.e., they are _dynamic_
predicates of type `data/1'.

   Predicates declared as persistent are linked to directory, and the
persistent state of the predicate will be kept in several files below
that directory. The files in which the persistent predicates are
stored are in readable, plain ASCII format, and in Prolog syntax. One
advantage of this approach is that such files can also be created or
edited by hand, in a text editor, or even by other applications.

   An example definition of a persistent predicate implemented by
files follows:

     :- persistent(p/3,dbdir).

     persistent_dir(dbdir, '/home/clip/public_html/db').

   The first line declares the predicate `p/3' persistent. The
argument `dbdir' is a key used to index into a fact of the relation `persistent_dir/2-4',
which specifies the directory where the corresponding files will be
kept. The effect of the declaration, together with the `persistent_dir/2-4'
fact, is that, although the predicate is handled in the same way as a
normal data predicate, in addition the system will create and
maintain efficiently a persistent version of `p/3' via files in the
directory `/home/clip/public_html/db'.

   The level of indirection provided by the `dbdir' argument makes it
easy to place the storage of several persistent predicates in a
common directory, by specifying the same key for all of them. It also
allows changing the directory for several such persistent predicates
by modifying only one fact in the program. Furthermore, the `persistent_dir/2-4'
predicate can even be dynamic and specified at run-time.

137.4 Implementation Issues
===========================

We outline the current implementation approach. This implementation
attempts to provide at the same time efficiency and security. To this
end, up to three files are used for each predicate (the persistence
set): the data file, the operations file, and the backup file. In the updated
state the facts (tuples) that define the predicate are stored in the
data file and the operations file is empty (the backup file, which
contains a security copy of the data file, may or may not exist).

   While a program using a persistent predicate is running, any
insertion (assert) or deletion (retract) operations on the predicate
are performed on both the program memory and on the persistence set.
However, in order to incurr only a small overhead in the execution,
rather than changing the data file directly, a record of each of the
insertion and deletion operations is _appended_ to the operations
file. The predicate is then in a transient state, in that the
contents of the data file do not reflect exactly the current state of
the corresponding predicate. However, the complete persistence set
does.

   When a program starts, all pending operations in the operations
file are performed on the data file. A backup of the data file is
created first to prevent data loss if the system crashes during this
operation. The order in which this updating of files is done ensures
that, if at any point the process dies, on restart the data will be
completely recovered. This process of updating the persistence set
can also be triggered at any point in the execution of the program
(for example, when halting) by calling `update_files'.

137.5 Defining an initial database
==================================

It is possible to define an initial database by simply including in
the program code facts of persistent predicates. They will be
included in the persistent database when it is created. They are
ignored in successive executions.

137.6 Using persistent predicates from the top level
====================================================

Special care must be taken when loading into the top level modules or
user files which use persistent predicates. Beforehand, a goal
`use_module(library(persdb(persdbrt)))' must be issued. Furthermore,
since persistent predicates defined by the loaded files are in this
way defined dynamically, a call to `initialize_db/0' is commonly
needed after loading and before calling predicates of these files.

137.7 Usage and interface (`persdbrt')
======================================

   * *Library usage:*

     There are two packages which implement persistence: `persdb' and `'persdb/ll''
     (for low level). In the first, the standard builtins `asserta_fact/1', `assertz_fact/1',
     and `retract_fact/1' are replaced by new versions which handle
     persistent data predicates, behaving as usual for normal data
     predicates. In the second package, predicates with names
     starting with `p' are defined, so that there is no overhead in
     calling the standard builtins. In any case, each package is used
     as usual: including it in the package list of the module, or
     using the `use_package/1' declaration.

   * *Exports:*

        - _Predicates:_

          `passerta_fact/1', `passertz_fact/1', `pretract_fact/1', `pretractall_fact/1', `asserta_fact/1', `assertz_fact/1', `retract_fact/1', `retractall_fact/1', `initialize_db/0', `make_persistent/2', `update_files/0', `update_files/1', `create/2'.

        - _Regular Types:_

          `meta_predname/1', `directoryname/1'.

        - _Multifiles:_

          `$is_persistent/2', `persistent_dir/2', `persistent_dir/4'.

   * *Other modules used:*

        - _System library modules:_

          `lists', `read', `aggregates', `system', `file_locks/file_locks', `persdb/persdbcache'.

(the preferred method) and dynamically (necessary when the new
persistent predicates have to be defined at run-time). The final

139 Filed predicates
********************

*Author(s):* Francisco Bueno.

   This package allows using files as a " cache" for predicates
defined by facts. This is useful for huge tables of facts that may
push the memory limits of the system too far. Goals of a filed
predicate are executed simply by reading from the corresponding file.

   Anything in the DB file used for the predicate that is different
from a fact for the corresponding predicate is ignored. Each call to
a filed predicate forces opening the file, so the use of this package
is subject to the limit on the number of open files that the system
can support.

   Dynamic modification of the filed predicates is also allowed
during execution of the program. Thus filed predicates are regarded
as dynamic, data predicates residing in a file. However, dynamic
modifications to the predicates do not affect the file, unless the
predicate is also declared persistent.

   The package is compatible with `persdb' in the sense that a
predicate can be made both filed and persistent. In this way, the
predicate can be used in programs, but it will not be loaded (saving
memory), can also be modified during execution, and modifications
will persist in the file. Thus, the user interface to both packages
is the same (so the DB file must be one for both filing and
persistency).

          a fact is deleted from the predicate definition. This is
          true even for the facts filed in the DB file for the
          predicate; but these are NOT deleted from the file (unless

141 SQL persistent database interface
*************************************

*Author(s):* Ignacio Caballero, Daniel Cabeza, Jose' Manuel Go'mez
Pe'rez, Manuel Hermenegildo, Jose F. Morales, Manuel Carro, The CLIP
Group.

   The purpose of this library is to implement an instance of the
generic concept of persistent predicates, where external relational
databases are used for storage (see the documentation of the `persdb'
library and [CHGT98,Par97] for details). To this end, this library
exports SQL persistent versions of the `assertz_fact/1', `retract_fact/1'
and `retractall_fact/1' builtin predicates. Persistent predicates
also allow concurrent updates from several programs, since each
update is atomic.

   The notion of persistence provides a very natural and transparent
way to access database relations from a Prolog program. Stub
definitions are provided for such predicates which access the
database when the predicate is called (using the `db_client'
library). A Prolog to SQL translator is used to generate the required SQL
code dynamically (see library `pl2sql').

   This library also provides facilities for reflecting more complex views
of the database relations as Prolog predicates. Such views can be
constructed as conjunctions, disjunctions, projections, etc. of
database relations. Also, SQL-like aggregation operations are
supported.

141.1 Implementation of the Database Interface
==============================================

The architecture of the low-level implementation of the database
interface was defined with two goals in mind:

   * to simplify the communication between the Prolog system and the
     relational database engines as much as possible, and

   * to give as much flexibility as possible to the overall system.
     This includes simultaneous access to several databases, allowing
     both the databases and clients to reside on the same physical
     machine or different machines, and allowing the clients to
     reside in Win95/NT or Unix machines.

   In order to allow the flexibility mentioned above, a client-sever
architecture was chosen. At the server side, a MySQL server connects
to the databases using the MySQL. At the client side, a MySQL client
interface connects to this server. The server daemon (mysqld) should
be running in the server machine; check your MySQL documentation on
how to do that.

   After the connection is established a client can send commands to
the mediator server which will pass them to the corresponding
database server, and then the data will traverse in the opposite
direction. These messages include logging on and off from the
database, sending SQL queries, and receiving the responses.

   The low level implementation of the current library is
accomplished by providing abstraction levels over the MySQL interface
library. These layers of abstraction implement the persistent
predicate view, build the appropriate commands for the database using
a translator of Prolog goals to SQL commands, issue such commands
using the mediator send/receive procedures, parse the responses, and
present such responses to the Prolog engine via backtracking.

141.3 Usage and interface (`persdbrt_mysql')
============================================

   * *Library usage:*

     Typically, this library is used including the 'persdb_mysql'
     package into the package list of the module, or using the `use_package/1'
     declaration:
    In a module:
               	:- module(bar, [main/1], [persdb_mysql]).
          or
                       :- module(bar, [main/1]).
                       :- include(library(persdb_mysql)).

    In a _user_ file:
               	:- use_package([persdb_mysql]).
          or
                       :- include(library(persdb_mysql)).
     This loads the run-time and compile-time versions of the library
     (`persdbtr_mysql.pl' and `persdbrt_mysql.pl') and includes some
     needed declarations.

   * *Exports:*

 -- PREDICATE: init_sql_persdb/0:
     *Usage:*
        - _Description:_ Internal predicate, used to transform
          predicates statically declared as persistent (see `sql_persistent/3')

 -- PREDICATE: dbassertz_fact/1:
     *Usage:* `dbassertz_fact(Fact)'
        - _Description:_ Persistent extension of `assertz_fact/1':
          the current instance of `Fact' is interpreted as a fact
          (i.e., a relation tuple) and is added to the end of the
          definition of the corresponding predicate. If any integrity
          constraint violation is done (database stored predicates),
          an error will be displayed. The predicate concerned must be
          statically ( `sql_persistent/3') or dinamically ( `make_sql_persistent/3')
          declared. Any uninstantiated variables in the `Fact' will

        - _Description:_ Persistent extension of `retractall_fact/1':
          when called deletes all the facts which unify with `Fact'.
          The predicate concerned must be statically ( `sql_persistent/3')
          or dinamically ( `make_sql_persistent/3') declared.

        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `Fact' is a fact (a term whose main functor is not

        - _Description:_ Internal predicate, used by the transformed
          versions of the persistent predicates. Not meant to be
          called directly by users. It is exported by the library so
          that it can be used by the transformed versions of the
          persistent predicates in the modules in which they reside.
          Sends `ComplexGoal' to database `DBId' for evaluation.

          `AnswerTableTerm' can express a set of tuples, an error
          answer or a 'ok' response (see `answertableterm/1' for
          details). At the moment, `sql_query/3' log in and out for
          each query. This should be changed to log in only the first

===================================================

 -- REGTYPE: tuple/1:
          tuple(T) :-
                  list(T,atm).
          tuple(T) :-
                  list(T,atm).

     *Usage:* `tuple(T)'
        - _Description:_ `T' is a tuple of values from the ODBC
          database interface.


 -- REGTYPE: dbconnection/1:
     *Usage:* `dbconnection(H)'
        - _Description:_ `H' a unique identifier of a database
          session connection.


 -- DECLARATION: sql_persistent/3:
     *Usage:* :-
     `sql_persistent(PrologPredTypes,TableAttributes,Keyword)'.
        - _Description:_ Declares the predicate corresponding to the
          main functor of `PrologPredTypes' as SQL persistent.
          `Keyword' is the name of a location where the persistent
          storage for the predicate is kept, which in this case must
          be an external relational database. The description of this
          database is given through the `sql_persistent_location'
          predicate, which must contain a fact in which the first
          argument unifies with `Keyword'. `TableAttributes' provides
          the table name and attributes in the database corresponding
          respectively to the predicate name and arguments of the
          (virtual) Prolog predicate.

          Although a predicate may be persistent, other usual clauses
          can be defined in the source code. When querying a
          persistent predicate with non-persistent clauses,
          persistent and non-persisten clauses will be evaluated in
          turn; the order of evaluation is the usual Prolog order,
          considering that persistent clauses are defined in the
          program point where the `sql_persistent/3' declaration is.

          *Example:*

               :- sql_persistent(product( integer,    integer, string, string ),
                             product( quantity,   id,      name,   size   ),
                             radiowebdb).

               sql_persistent_location(radiowebdb,
                  db('SQL Anywhere 5.0 Sample', user, pass,
                     'r2d5.dia.fi.upm.es':2020)).

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          are the response from database `DBId' to the Prolog query
          `Goal', projected onto `ProjTerm'. Uses `pl2sqlstring/3'
          for the Prolog to SQL translation and `sql_query/3' for
          posing the actual query.

        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          the response from database `DBId' to the Prolog query
          `Goal', projected onto `ProjTerm'. Uses `pl2sqlstring/3'
          for the Prolog to SQL translation and `sql_query_one_tuple/3'
          for posing the actual query. After last tuple has been
          reached, a null tuple is unified with ResultTerm, and the
          connection to the database finishes.

        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

 -- PREDICATE: sql_query_one_tuple/3:
     *Usage:* `sql_query_one_tuple(DBId,SQLString,ResultTuple)'
        - _Description:_ `ResultTuple' contains an element from the
          set of tuples which represents the response in `DBId' to the SQL
          query `SQLString'. If the connection is kept, succesive
          calls return consecutive tuples, until the last tuple is
          reached. Then a null tuple is unified with `ResultTuple'
          and the connection is finished (calls to `mysql_disconnect/1').

============================================================

   * At least in the shell, reloading a file after changing the
     definition of a persistent predicate does not eliminate the old
     definition...

   * Functionality missing: some questions need to be debugged.

   * Warning: still using kludgey string2term and still using some
     non-uniquified temp files.

   * Needs to be unified with the file-based library.

142 Prolog to SQL translator
****************************

*Author(s):* Christoph Draxler, Manuel Hermenegildo (adaptation), Ignacio
Caballero (adaptation).

   This library performs translation of Prolog queries into SQL. The
code is an adaptation for Ciao of the Prolog to SQL compiler written
by Christoph Draxler, CIS Centre for Information and Speech
Processing, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich,
`draxler@cis.uni-muenchen.de', Version 1.1. Many thanks to Christoph
for allowing us to include this adaptation of his code with Ciao.

   The translator needs to know the correspondence between Prolog
predicates and the SQL tables in the database. To this end this
module exports two multifile predicates, `sql__relation/3' and `sql__attribute/4'.
See the description of these predicates for details on how such
correspondance is specified.

   The main entry points to the translator are `pl2sqlstring/3' and `pl2sqlterm/3'.
Details on the types of queries allowed can be found in the
description of these predicates.

   *Example:* the following program would print out a term
representing the SQL query corresponding to the given Prolog query:


   *Note*: while the translator can be used directly in programs, it
is more convenient to use a higher-level abstraction: persistent
predicates (implemented in the `persdb' library). The notion of
persistent predicates provides a completely transparent interface
between Prolog and relational databases. When using this library, the
Prolog to SQL translation is called automatically as needed.

=========================================

 -- PREDICATE: pl2sqlstring/3:
     *Usage:*
     `pl2sqlstring(ProjectionTerm,DatabaseGoal,SQLQueryString)'
        - _Description:_ This is the top level predicate which
          translates complex Prolog goals into the corresponding SQL
          code.

          The query code is prepared in such a way that the result is
          projected onto the term `ProjectionTerm' (also in a similar
          way to the first argument of `setof/3')). See the predicate `translate_projection/3'
          for restrictions on this term.

          `SQLQueryString' contains the code of the SQL query, ready
          to be sent to an SQL server.

        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `ProjectionTerm' is a database projection term.
          (pl2sql:projterm/1)

          `DatabaseGoal' is a database query goal.
          (pl2sql:querybody/1)

          `SQLQueryString' is a string containing SQL code.
          (pl2sql:sqlstring/1)

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `ProjectionTerm' is currently a term which is not a free
          variable.   (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `DatabaseGoal' is currently a term which is not a free
          variable.   (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `SQLQueryString' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)


 -- REGTYPE: querybody/1:
     `DBGoal' is a goal meant to be executed in the external
     database. It can be a complex term containing conjunctions, disjunctions,
     and negations, of:

        * Atomic goals, which must have been defined via `sql__relation/3'
          and `sql__attribute/4' and reside in the (same) database.
          Their arguments must be either ground or free variables. If
          they are ground, they must be bound to constants of the
          type declared for that argument. If an argument is a free
          variable, it may _share_ with (i.e., be the same variable
          as) other free variables in other goal arguments.

        * Database comparison goals, whose main functor must be a database
          comparison operator (see `pl2sql': `comparison/2') and
          whose arguments must be _database arithmetic expressions_.

        * Database calls to is/2. The left side of such a call may be
          either unbound, in which case it is bound to the result of
          evaluating the right side, or bound in which case an
          equality condition is tested. The right side must be a
          _database arithmetic expression_.


     The binding of variables follows Prolog rules:

        * variables are bound by positive base goals and on the left
          side of the `is/2' predicate.

        * Comparison operations, negated goals, and right sides of the `is/2'
          predicate do not return variable bindings and may even
          require all arguments to be bound for a safe evaluation.


     Database arithmetic expressions may contain:

        * Numeric constants (i.e., integers, reals, etc.).

        * Bound variables, i.e., variables which will be bound during
          execution through occurrence within a positive database
          goal, or by a preceding arithmetic function.

        * Database arithmetic functions, which are a subset of those
          typically accepted within `is/2' (see `pl2sql': `arithmetic_functor/2').

        * Database aggregation functions, each of which has two
          arguments: a variable indicating the argument over which
          the function is to be computed, and a goal argument which
          must contain in at least one argument position the variable
          (e.g. `avg(Seats, plane(Type, Seats))'). The goal argument
          may only be a conjunction of (positive or negative) base
          goals. See `pl2sql': `aggregate_functor/2' for the
          admissible aggregate functions.


     In addition, variables can be existentially quantified using `^/2'
     (in a similar way to how it is done in `setof/3').

     Note that it is assumed that the arithmetic operators in Prolog
     and SQL are the same, i.e., `+' is addition in Prolog and in
     SQL, etc.

     *Usage:* `querybody(DBGoal)'
        - _Description:_ `DBGoal' is a database query goal.


 -- REGTYPE: projterm/1:
     `DBProjTerm' is a term onto which the result of a database query
     code is (in a similar way to the first argument of `setof/3')).

     A `ProjectionTerm' must meet the following restrictions:

        * The functor of `ProjectionTerm' may not be one of the
          built-in predicates, i.e. ',', ';', etc. are not allowed.

        * Only variables and constants are allowed as arguments,
          i.e., no structured terms may appear.


     *Usage:* `projterm(DBProjTerm)'
        - _Description:_ `DBProjTerm' is a database projection term.


 -- REGTYPE: sqlstring/1:
          sqlstring(S) :-
                  string(S).

     *Usage:* `sqlstring(S)'
        - _Description:_ `S' is a string containing SQL code.


 -- PREDICATE: pl2sqlterm/3:
     *Usage:* `pl2sqlterm(ProjectionTerm,DatabaseGoal,SQLQueryTerm)'
        - _Description:_ Similar to `pl2sqlstring/3' except that
          `SQLQueryTerm' is a representation of the SQL query as a
          Prolog term.

        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `ProjectionTerm' is a database projection term.
          (pl2sql:projterm/1)

          `DatabaseGoal' is a database query goal.

          variable.   (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `DatabaseGoal' is currently a term which is not a free
          variable.   (term_typing:nonvar/1)

          `SQLQueryTerm' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)


 -- PREDICATE: sqlterm2string/2:
     *Usage:* `sqlterm2string(Queries,QueryString)'
        - _Description:_ `QueryString' is a string representation of
          the list of queries in Prolog-term format in `Queries'.

        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `Queries' is a list of `sqlterm's.   (basic_props:list/2)

          `QueryString' is a string containing SQL code.

142.3 Documentation on multifiles (`pl2sql')
============================================

 -- PREDICATE: sql__relation/3:
     The predicate is _multifile_.

     The predicate is of type _data_.

     *Usage:* `sql__relation(PredName,Arity,TableName)'
        - _Description:_ This predicate, together with `sql__attribute/4',
          defines the correspondence between Prolog predicates and the SQL
          tables in the database. These two relations constitute an
          extensible meta-database which maps Prolog predicate names
          to SQL table names, and Prolog predicate argument positions
          to SQL attributes.

          `PredName' is the chosen Prolog name for an SQL table.
          `Arity' is the number of arguments of the predicate.
          `TableName' is the name of the SQL table in the Database
          Management System.

        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `PredName' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

          `Arity' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `TableName' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)


 -- PREDICATE: sql__attribute/4:
     The predicate is _multifile_.

     The predicate is of type _data_.

     *Usage:* `sql__attribute(ANumber,TblName,AName,AType)'
        - _Description:_ This predicate maps the argument positions
          of a Prolog predicate to the SQL attributes of its
          corresponding table. The types of the arguments need to be
          specified, and this information is used for consistency
          checking during the translation and for output formatting.
          A minimal type system is provided to this end. The
          allowable types are given by `sqltype/1'.

          `ANumber' is the argument number in the Prolog relation.
          `TblName' is the name of the SQL table in the Database
          Management System. `AName' is the name of the corresponding
          attribute in the table. `AType' is the (translator) data
          type of the attribute.

        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `ANumber' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `TblName' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

          `AName' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

          `AType' is an SQL data type supported by the translator.

===========================================

 -- PREDICATE: query_generation/3:
     *Usage:*
     `query_generation(ListOfConjunctions,ProjectionTerm,ListOfQueries)'
        - _Description:_ For each Conjunction in
          `ListOfConjunctions', translate the pair `(ProjectionTerm,
          Conjunction)' to an SQL query and connect each such query
          through a UNION-operator to result in the `ListOfQueries'.

          A Conjunction consists of positive or negative subgoals.
          Each subgoal is translated as follows:

             * the functor of a goal that is not a comparison
               operation is translated to a relation name with a range
               variable,

             * negated goals are translated to NOT EXISTS-subqueries
               with * projection,

             * comparison operations are translated to comparison
               operations in the WHERE-clause,

             * aggregate function terms are translated to aggregate
               function (sub)queries.


          The arguments of a goal are translated as follows:

             * `variables of a goal' are translated to qualified
               attributes,

             * variables occurring in several goals are translated to
               equality comparisons (equi join) in the WHERE-clause, 

             * constant arguments are translated to equality
               comparisons in the WHERE-clause.


          Arithmetic functions are treated specially ( `translate_arithmetic_function/5').
          See also `querybody/1' for details on the syntax accepted

148 Prolog/Java Bidirectional Interface
***************************************

*Author(s):* Jesu's Correas, The CLIP Group.

   The increasing diversity of platforms used today and the diffusion
of Internet and the World Wide Web makes compatibility between
platforms a key factor to run the software everywhere with no change.
Java seems to achieve this goal, using a bytecode intermediate
language and a large library of platform-dependent and independent
classes which fully implements many. On the other hand, Prolog
provides a powerful implementation of logic programming paradigm.
This document includes the reference manual of the Prolog/Java
bidirectional interface implemented in Ciao. In addition, it has been
developed an application of this interface that makes use of an
object oriented extension of Prolog to encapsulate the java classes,
O'Ciao, both the ones defined in the JDK as well as new classes
developed in Java. These classes can be used in the object oriented
prolog extension of Ciao just like native O'Ciao classes.

   The proposed interaction between both languages is realized as an
interface between two processes, a Java process and a Prolog process,
running separately. This approach allows the programmer to use of
both Java and Prolog, without the compiler-dependent glue code used
in other linkage-oriented approaches, and preserves the philosophy of
Java as an independent language. The interface communication is based
on a clean socket-based protocol, providing hardware and software
independence. This allows also both processes to be run in different
machines connected by a TCP/IP transport protocol, based on a
client/server model that can evolve to a more cooperative model.

   The present manual includes reference information about the Prolog
side of the bidirectional Java/Prolog interface. The Java side of
this interface is explained in the HTML pages generated by Javadoc.

148.1 Distributed Programming Model
===================================

The differences between Prolog and Java impose the division of the
interface in two main parts: a prolog-to-java and a java-to-prolog
interfaces. Most of the applications that will use this interface
will consider that will be a "client' side that request actions and
queries to a "server' side, which accomplish the actions and answer
the queries. In a first approach, any of the both one-way interfaces
implement a pure client/server model: the server waits for a query,
performs the received query and sleeps until the next query comes;
the client starts the server, carries out the initial part of the job
initiating all the conversations with the server, and requests the
server to do some things sometimes.

   This model cannot handle correctly the tasks regarding an event
oriented programming environment like java. A usual application of
the prolog-to-java interface could be a graphical user interface
server made in java, and a prolog client on the other side. A pure
client/server model based on requests and results is not powerful
enough to leave the prolog side managing all the application specific
work of this example: some java specific stuff is needed to catch and
manipulate properly the events thrown by the graphical user
interface. This problem can be solved in a distributed context, on
which both languages are clients and servers simultaneously, and can
perform requests and do actions at a time. Using this model, the
prolog side can add a prolog goal as listener of a specific event,
and the java side launches that goal when the event raises.

   In any case, the client/server approach simplifies the design of
the interface, so both interfaces have been designed in such way, but
keeping in mind that the goal is to reach a distributed environment,
so each side do the things it is best designed for.

149 Prolog to Java interface
****************************

*Author(s):* Jesu's Correas.

   This module defines the Ciao Prolog to Java interface. This
interface allows a Prolog program to start a Java process, create
Java objects, invoke methods, set/get attributes (fields), and handle
Java events.

   This interface only works with JDK version 1.2 or higher.

   Although the Java side interface is explained in Javadoc format
(it is available at `library/javall/javadoc/' in your Ciao
installation), the general interface structure is detailed here.

149.1 Prolog to Java Interface Structure
========================================

This interface is made up of two parts: a Prolog part and a Java
part, running in separate processes. The Prolog part receives
requests from a Prolog program and sends them to the Java part
through a socket. The Java part receives requests from the socket and
performs the actions included in the requests.

   If an event is thrown in the Java side, an asynchronous message
must be sent away to the Prolog side, in order to launch a Prolog
goal to handle the event. This asynchronous communication is
performed using a separate socket. The nature of this communication
needs the use of threads both in Java and Prolog: to deal with the
'sequential program flow,' and other threads for event handling.

   In both sides the threads are automatically created by the context
of the objects we use. The user must be aware that different requests
to the other side of the interface could run concurrently.

149.1.1 Prolog side of the Java interface
-----------------------------------------

The Prolog side receives the actions to do in the Java side from the
user program, and sends them to the Java process through the socket
connection. When the action is done in the Java side, the result is
returned to the user Prolog program, or the action fails if there is
any problem in the Java side.

   Prolog data representation of Java elements is very simple in this
interface. Java primitive types such as integers and characters are
translated into the Prolog corresponding terms, and even some Java
objects are translated in the same way (e. g. Java strings). Java
objects are represented in Prolog as compound terms with a reference
id to identify the corresponding Java object. Data conversion is made
automatically when the interface is used, so the Prolog user programs
do not have to deal with the complexity of these tasks.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Java side,  Prev: Prolog side of the Java interface,  Up: Prolog to Java Interface Structure

149.1.2 Java side
-----------------

The Java side of this layer is more complex than the Prolog side. The
tasks this part has to deal with are the following:

   * Wait for requests from the Prolog side.

   * Translate the Prolog terms received in the Prolog 'serialized'
     form to a more useful Java representation (see the Java
     interface documentation available at `library/javall/javadoc/'
     in your Ciao installation for details regarding Java
     representation of Prolog terms).

   * Interpret the requests received from the Prolog side, and
     execute them.

   * Handle the set of objects created by or derived from the
     requests received from the prolog side.

   * Handle the events raised in the Java side, and launch the
     listeners added in the prolog side.

   * Handle the exceptions raised in the Java side, and send them to
     the Prolog side.


   In the implementation of the Java side, two items must be
carefully designed: the handling of Java objects, and the
representation of prolog data structures. The last item is specially
important because all the interactions between Prolog and Java are
made using Prolog structures, an easy way to standardize the
different data management in both sides. Even the requests themselves
are encapsulated using Prolog structures. The overload of this
encapsulation is not significant in terms of socket traffic, due to
the optimal implementation of the prolog serialized term.

   The java side must handle the objects created from the Prolog side
dinamically, and these objects must be accessed as fast as possible
from the set of objects. The Java API provides a powerful
implementation of Hash tables that achieves all the requirements of
our implementation.

   On the other hand, the java representation of prolog terms is made
using the inheritance of java classes. In the java side there exists
a representation of a generic prolog term, implemented as an abstract
class in java. Variables, atoms, compound terms, lists, and numeric
terms are classes in the java side which inherit from the term class.
Java objects can be seen also under the prolog representation as
compound terms, where the single argument corresponds to the Hash key
of the actual java object in the Hash table referred to before. This
behaviour makes the handling of mixed java and prolog elements easy.
Prolog goals are represented in the java side as objects which
contain a prolog compound term with the term representing the goal.
This case will be seen more in depth in next chapter, where the java
to prolog interface is explained.

149.2 Java event handling from Prolog
=====================================

Java event handling is based on a delegation model since version
1.1.x. This approach to event handling is very powerful and elegant,
but a user program cannot handle all the events that can arise on a
given object: for each kind of event, a listener must be implemented
and added specifically. However, the Java 2 API includes a special
listener (`AWTEventListener') that can manage the internal java event
queue.

   The prolog to java interface has been designed to emulate the java
event handler, and is also based on event objects and listeners. The
prolog to java interface implements its own event manager, to handle
those events that have prolog listeners associated to the object that
raises the event. From the prolog side can be added listeners to
objects for specific events. The java side includes a list of goals
to launch from the object and event type.

   Due to the events nature, the event handler must work in a
separate thread to manage the events asynchronously. The java side
has its own mechanisms to work this way. The prolog side must be
implemented specially for event handling using threads. The
communication between java and prolog is also asynchronous, and an
additional socket stream is used to avoid interferences with the main
socket stream. The event stream will work in this implementation only
in one way: from java to prolog. If an event handler needs to send
back requests to java, it will use the main socket stream, just like
the requests sent directly from a prolog program.

   The internal process of register a Prolog event handler to a Java
event is shown in the next figure:

   When an event raises, the Prolog to Java interface has to send to
the Prolog user program the goal to evaluate. Graphically, the
complete process takes the tasks involved in the following figure:

149.3 Java exception handling from Prolog
=========================================

Java exception handling is very similar to the peer prolog handling:
it includes some specific statements to trap exceptions from user
code. In the java side, the exceptions can be originated from an
incorrect request, or can be originated in the code called from the
request. Both exception types will be sent to prolog using the main
socket stream, allowing the prolog program manage the exception.
However, the first kind of exceptions are prefixed, so the user
program can distinguish them from the second type of exceptions.

   In order to handle exceptions properly using the prolog to java
and java to prolog interfaces simultaneously, in both sides of the
interface those exceptions coming from their own side will be
filtered: this avoids an endless loop of exceptions bouncing from one
side to another.

150 Java to Prolog interface
****************************

*Author(s):* Jesu's Correas.

   This module defines the Prolog side of the Java to Prolog
interface. This side of the interface only has one public predicate:
a server that listens at the socket connection with Java, and
executes the commands received from the Java side.

   In order to evaluate the goals received from the Java side, this
module can work in two ways: executing them in the same engine, or
starting a thread for each goal. The easiest way is to launch them in
the same engine, but the goals must be evaluated sequentially: once a
goal provides the first solution, all the subsequent goals must be
finished before this goal can backtrack to provide another solution.
The Prolog side of this interface works as a top-level, and the goals
partially evaluated are not independent.

   The solution of this goal dependence is to evaluate the goals in a
different prolog engine. Although Ciao includes a mechanism to
evaluate goals in different engines, the approach used in this
interface is to launch each goal in a different thread.

   The decision of what kind of goal evaluation is selected is done
by the Java side. Each evaluation type has its own command terms, so
the Java side can choose the type it needs.

   A Prolog server starts by calling the `prolog_server/0' predicate,
or by calling `prolog_server/1' predicate and providing the port
number as argument. The user predicates and libraries to be called
from Java must be included in the executable file, or be accesible
using the built-in predicates dealing with code loading.

150.2 Documentation on exports (`jtopl')
========================================

 -- PREDICATE: prolog_server/0:
     *Usage:*
        - _Description:_ Prolog server entry point. Reads from the
          standard input the node name and port number where the java
          client resides, and starts the prolog server listening at
          the jp socket. This predicate acts as a server: it includes
          an endless read-process loop until the `prolog_halt'
          command is received.

          However, from the low-level communication point of view,
          this Prolog server actually works as a client of the Java
          side. This means that Java side waits at the given port to
          a Prolog server trying to create a socket; Prolog side
          connects to that port, and then waits for Java requests
          (acting as a 'logical' server). To use this Prolog server
          as a real server waiting for connections at a given port,
          use `prolog_server/1'.



 -- PREDICATE: prolog_server/1:
     *Usage:*
        - _Description:_ Waits for incoming Java connections to act
          as a Prolog goal server for Java requests.This is the only
          `prolog_server/*' predicate that works as a true server:
          given a port number, waits for a connection from Java and
          then serves Java requests. When a termination request is
          received, finishes the connection to Java and waits next
          Java connection request. This behaviour is different with
          respect to previous versions of this library. To work as
          before, use `prolog_server/2'.

          Although it currently does not support simultaneous Java
          connections, some work is being done in that direction.  

        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `Arg1' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)


 -- PREDICATE: prolog_server/2:
     *Usage:*
        - _Description:_ Prolog server entry point. Given a network
          `node' and a `port' number, starts the prolog server trying
          to connect to Java side at that `node:port' address, and
          then waits for Java requests. This predicate acts as a
          server: it includes an endless read-process loop until the
          `prolog_halt' command is received.

          However, from the low-level communication point of view,
          this Prolog server actually works as a client of the Java
          side. This means that Java side waits at the given port to
          a Prolog server trying to create a socket; Prolog side
          connects to that port, and then waits for Java requests
          (acting as a 'logical' server). To use this Prolog server
          as a real server waiting for connections at a given port,
          use `prolog_server/1'.  

        - _Call and exit should be compatible with:_

          `Arg1' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

          `Arg2' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)


 -- PREDICATE: shell_s/0:
     *Usage:*
        - _Description:_ Command execution loop. This predicate is
          called when the connection to Java is established, and
          performs an endless loop processing the commands received.
          This predicate is only intended to be used by the Prolog to
          Java interface and it should not be used by a user program.

152 Calling emacs from Prolog
*****************************

*Author(s):* The CLIP Group.

   This library provides a _prolog-emacs interface_. This interface
is complementary to (and independent from) the emacs mode, which is
used to develop programs from within the `emacs' editor/environment.
Instead, this library allows calling `emacs' from a running Prolog
program. This facilitates the use of `emacs' as a "user interface"
for a Prolog program. Emacs can be made to:

   * Visit a file, which can then be edited.

   * Execute arbitrary _emacs lisp_ code, sent from Prolog.


In order for this library to work correctly, the following is needed:

   * You should be running the `emacs' editor on the same machine
     where the executable calling this library is executing.

   * This `emacs' should be running the _emacs server_. This can be
     done by including the following line in your `.emacs' file:

          ;; Start a server that emacsclient can connect to.
          (server-start)

     Or typing `M-x server-start' within `emacs'.


This suffices for using `emacs' to edit files. For running arbitrary
code the following also needs to be added to the `.emacs' file:

`(setq enable-local-eval t)'
     Allows executing lisp code without asking.

`(setq enable-local-eval nil)'
     Does not allow executing lisp code without asking.

`(setq enable-local-eval 'maybe)'
     Allows executing lisp code only if user agrees after asking
     (asks interactively for every invocation).


*Examples:*

Assuming that a `.pl' file loads this library, then:

`..., emacs_edit('foo'), ...'
     Opens file `foo' for editing in `emacs'.

`..., emacs_eval_nowait("(run-ciao-toplevel)"), ...'
     Starts execution of a Ciao top-level within `emacs'.

155 Association between key and value
*************************************

*Author(s):* Pablo Chico, Manuel Carro.

   This library implements a table. It takes its name from the
classical "association lists". It allows storing a set of values and
a key for each value, such that the values can later be accessed
through these keys. These keys could not be ground terms, but they
could not be instanciated later (so, this implementation unify with
'==' instead of '='). The implementation uses a dynamically changing
data structure for efficiency. When there are few elements the data
structure used is a list of pairs. When the number of elements stored
goes beyond some number, an AVL tree is used. There is a certain
level of hysteresis so that no repeated data structure conversions
occur when the number of elements is close to the threshold.

 -- PREDICATE: match_pattern/2:
     *Usage:* `match_pattern(Pattern,String)'
        - _Description:_ Matches `String' against `Pattern'. For
          example, `match_pattern("*.pl","foo.pl")' succeeds.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Pattern' is a pattern to match against.
          (patterns:pattern/1)

          `String' is a string (a list of character codes).
          (basic_props:string/1)


 -- PREDICATE: match_pattern/3:
     *Usage:* `match_pattern(Pattern,String,Tail)'
        - _Description:_ Matches `String' against `Pattern'. `Tail'
          is the remainder of the string after the match. For
          example, `match_pattern("??*","foo.pl",Tail)' succeeds,
          instantiating `Tail' to `"o.pl"'.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Pattern' is a pattern to match against.
          (patterns:pattern/1)

          `String' is a string (a list of character codes).
          (basic_props:string/1)

          `Tail' is a string (a list of character codes).
          (basic_props:string/1)


 -- PREDICATE: case_insensitive_match/2:
     *Usage:* `case_insensitive_match(Pred1,Pred2)'
        - _Description:_ Tests if two predicates `Pred1' and `Pred2'
          match in a case-insensitive way.


 -- PREDICATE: letter_match/2:
     *Usage:* `letter_match(X,Y)'
        - _Description:_ True iff `X' and `Y' represents the same
          letter


 -- REGTYPE: pattern/1:
     Special characters for `Pattern' are:
    *
          Matches any string, including the null string.

    ?
          Matches any single character.

    [...]
          Matches any one of the enclosed characters. A pair of
          characters separated by a minus sign denotes a range; any
          character lexically between those two characters,
          inclusive, is matched. If the first character following the
          [ is a ^ then any character not enclosed is matched. No
          other character is special inside this construct. To
          include a ] in a character set, you must make it the first
          character. To include a `-', you must use it in a context
          where it cannot possibly indicate a range: that is, as the
          first character, or immediately after a range.

    |
          Specifies an alternative. Two patterns A and B with | in
          between form an expression that matches anything that
          either A or B will match.

    {...}
          Groups alternatives inside larger patterns.

    \
          Quotes a special character (including itself).

     *Usage:* `pattern(P)'
        - _Description:_ `P' is a pattern to match against.


 -- PREDICATE: match_pattern_pred/2:
     *Usage:* `match_pattern_pred(Pred1,Pred2)'
        - _Description:_ Tests if two predicates `Pred1' and `Pred2'
          match using regular expressions.

161 Unweighted graph-processing utilities
*****************************************

*Author(s):* Richard A. O'Keefe (original shared code), Mats Carlsson
(adapted from original code), Francisco Bueno (modifications), Manuel
Carro (modifications).

   An unweighted directed graph (ugraph) is represented as a list of
(vertex-neighbors) pairs, where the pairs are in standard order (as
produced by keysort with unique keys) and the neighbors of each
vertex are also in standard order (as produced by sort), and every
neighbor appears as a vertex even if it has no neighbors itself.

   An undirected graph is represented as a directed graph where for
each edge `(U,V)' there is a symmetric edge `(V,U)'.

   An edge `(U,V)' is represented as the term `U-V'.

   A vertex can be any term. Two vertices are distinct iff they are
not identical ( `==/2').

   A path is represented as a list of vertices. No vertex can appear
twice in a path.

168.1 Usage (cleandirs)
=======================


     cleandirs [--silent] <initial_dir> <delete_options> <backup_options>
     cleandirs explores <initial_dir> (which should be an absolute path)
     and looks for backup files and files which can be generated from other
     files, using a plausible heuristic aimed at retaining the same amount
     of information while recovering some disk space.  The heuristic is
     based on the extension of the filename.

     Delete options is one of:
        --list: just list the files/directories which are amenable to be deleted,
                but do not delete them. SAFE.
         --ask: list the files/directories and ask for deletion. UNSAFE if you
                make a mistake.
      --delete: just delete the files/directories without asking.  I envy your
                brave soul if you choose this option.

     Backup options is one of:
      --includebackups: include backup files in the list of files to check.
      --excludebackups: do not include backup files in the list of files
                        to check.
         --onlybackups: include only backup files in the list of files to check.

     Symbolic links are not traversed.  Special files are not checked.

   Invoking the program with no arguments will return an up-to-date
information on the options.

169 Printing the declarations and code in a file
************************************************

*Author(s):* Manuel Hermenegildo.

   A simple program for printing assertion information ( predicate
declarations, property declarations, type declarations, etc.) and printing
code-related information ( imports, exports, libraries used, etc.) on
a file. The file should be a single Ciao or Prolog source file. It
uses the Ciao compiler's pass one to do it. This program is specially
useful for example for checking what assertions the assertion
normalizer is producing from the original assertions in the file or
to check what the compiler is actually seeing after some of the
syntactic expansions (but before goal translations).

169.1 Usage (fileinfo)
======================


         fileinfo -asr <filename.asr>
            : pretty prints the contents of <filename.asr>

         fileinfo [-v] [-m] <-a|-f|-c|-e> <filename> [libdir1] ... [libdirN]
         -v : verbose output (e.g., lists all files read)
         -m : restrict info to current module
         -a : print assertions
         -f : print code and interface (imports/exports, etc.)
         -c : print code only
         -e : print only errors - useful to check syntax of assertions in file

         fileinfo -h
            : print this information

         Note that system lib paths *must* be given explicitly, e.g. :

         fileinfo -m -c foo.pl \

169.2 More detailed explanation of options (fileinfo)
=====================================================

   * If the `-a' option is selected, `fileinfo' prints the assertions
     (only code-oriented assertions - not comment-oriented
     assertions) in the file _after normalization_. If the `-f'
     option is selected `fileinfo' prints the file interface, the
     declarations contained in the file, and the actual code. The
     `-c' option prints only the code. If the `-e' option is selected
     `fileinfo' prints only any sintactic and import-export errors
     found in the file, including the assertions.

   * `filename' must be the name of a Prolog or Ciao source file.

   * This filename can be followed by other arguments which will be
     taken to be library directory paths in which to look for files
     used by the file being analyzed.

   * If the `-m' option is selected, only the information related to
     the current module is printed.

   * The `-v' option produces verbose output. This is very useful for
     debugging, since all the files accessed during assertion
     normalization are listed.

   * In the `-asr' usage, `fileinfo' can be used to print the
     contents of a `.asr' file in human-readable form.

********************************************

*Author(s):* Daniel Cabeza, Manuel Hermenegildo.

   This simple program takes a single Ciao or Prolog source filename
(which is typically the main file of an application). It prints out
the list of all the dependent files, i.e., all files needed in order
to build the application, including those which reside in libraries.
This is particularly useful in Makefiles, for building standalone
distributions (e.g., .tar files) automatically.

   The filename should be followed by other arguments which will be
taken to be library directory paths in which to look for files used
by the file being analyzed.

174 The Ciao lpmake scripting facility
**************************************

*Author(s):* Manuel Hermenegildo, The CLIP Group.

   *Note*: `lpmake' and the `make' library are still under
development, and they may change in future releases.

   `lpmake' is a Ciao application which uses the Ciao `make' library
to implement a dependency-driven scripts in a similar way to the Un*x `make'
facility.

   The original purpose of the Un*x `make' utility is to determine
automatically which pieces of a large program needed to be
recompiled, and issue the commands to recompile them. In practice, `make'
is often used for many other purposes: it can be used to describe any
task where some files must be updated automatically from others
whenever these change.  `lpmake' can be used for the same types of
applications as `make', and also for some new ones, and, while being
simpler, it offers a number of advantages over `make'. The first one
is _portability_. When compiled to a bytecode executable `lpmake'
runs on any platform where a Ciao engine is available. Also, the fact
that typically many of the operations are programmed in Prolog within
the makefile, not needing external applications, improves portability
further. The second advantage of `lpmake' is _improved programming
capabilities_. While `lpmake' is simpler than `make', `lpmake' allows
using the Ciao Prolog language within the scripts. This allows
establising more complex dependencies and programming powerful
operations within the make file, and without resorting to external
packages (e.g., operating system commands), which also helps
portability. A final advantage of `lpmake' is that it supports a form
of _autodocumentation_: comments associated to targets can be
included in the configuration files. Calling `lpmake' in a directory
which has such a configuration file explains what commands the
configuration file support and what these commands will do.

File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: General operation,  Next: Format of the Configuration File,  Prev: The Ciao lpmake scripting facility,  Up: The Ciao lpmake scripting facility

174.1 General operation
=======================

To prepare to use `lpmake', and in a similar way to `make', you must
write a _configuration file_: a module (typically called `Makefile.pl')
that describes the relationships among files in your program or
application, and states the commands for updating each file. In the
case of compiling a program, typically the executable file is
obtained from object files, which are in turn obtained by compiling
source files. Another example is running `latex' and `dvips' on a set
of source `.tex' files to generate a document in `dvi' and
`postscript' formats.

   Once a suitable make file exists, each time you change some source
files, simply typing `lpmake' suffices to perform all necessary
operations (recompilations, processing text files, etc.). The `lpmake'
program uses the dependency rules in the makefile and the last
modification times of the files to decide which of the files need to
be updated. For each of those files, it issues the commands recorded
in the makefile. For example, in the `latex'/ `dvips' case one rule
states that the `.dvi' file whould be updated from the `.tex' files
whenever one of them changes and another rule states that the `.ps'
file needs to be updated from a `.dvi' file every time it changes.
The rules also describe the commands to be issued to update the files.

   So, the general process is as follows: `lpmake' executes commands
in the configuration file to update one or more target _names_, where
_name_ is often a program, but can also be a file to be generated or
even a "virtual" target.  `lpmake' updates a target if it depends on
prerequisite files that have been modified since the target was last
modified, or if the target does not exist. You can provide command
line arguments to `lpmake' to control which files should be
regenerated, or how.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Format of the Configuration File,  Next: lpmake usage,  Prev: General operation,  Up: The Ciao lpmake scripting facility

174.2 Format of the Configuration File
======================================

`lpmake' uses as default configuration file the file `Makefile.pl',
if it is present in the current directory. This can be overridden and
another file used by means of the `-m' option. The configuration file
must be a _module_ and this module must make use of the `make'
package. This package provides syntax for defining the dependency
rules and functionality for correctly interpreting these rules.

   The configuration file can contain such rules and also arbitrary
Ciao Prolog predicates, and can also import other Ciao modules,
packages, or make file. This is useful to implement inherintance
across diferent configuration files, i.e., the values declared in a
configuration file can be easily made to override those defined in
another, using the standard Ciao rules for module overriding,
reexport, etc. The syntax of the rules is described in *note The Ciao
Make Package::, together with some examples.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: lpmake usage,  Next: Acknowledgments (lpmake),  Prev: Format of the Configuration File,  Up: The Ciao lpmake scripting facility

174.3 lpmake usage
==================



     Supported command line options:

     lpmake [-v] [-d Name1=Value1] ... [-d Namen=Valuen] \
     	<command1> ... <commandn>

       Process commands <command1> ... <commandn>, using file 'Makefile.pl'
       or directory 'installer' in the current directory as configuration
       file. The configuration file must be a module.

       The optional argument '-v' produces verbose output, reporting on the
       processing of the dependency rules.  Very useful for debugging
       makefiles.

       The argument '-d' indicates that a variable definition Name=Value
       follows.  The effect of this is adding the fact 'name_value(Name, Value).'
       (i.e., 'name_value(Name) := Value.'), defined in the module
       library(make(make_rt)).

     lpmake [-v] [-d Name1=Value1] ... [-d Namen=Valuen] \
     	[[-m|-l] <.../Configfile1.pl>] [[-m|-l] <.../Configfilen.pl>] \
             <command1> ... <commandn>

       Same as above, but using files <.../Configfilex.pl> as configuration
       file. One or more configuration files can be used. When using more
       than one configuration file, the additional configuration files are
       loaded dynamically into the first one with the predicate
       register_config_file/1.  Using -l instead of -m indicates that this
       configuration file is a library module (i.e., it will be looked for
       in the libraries).

     lpmake -h     [ [-m|-l] <.../Configfile.pl> ]
     lpmake -help  [ [-m|-l] <.../Configfile.pl> ]
     lpmake --help [ [-m|-l] <.../Configfile.pl> ]

       Print this help message. If a configuration file is available in the
       current directory or is given as an option, and the commands in it
       are commented, then information on these commands is also printed.

The script copies the ciao distribution passed on as first argument
to a subdirectory of the directory name passed as second argument.
The subdirectory is always the same, in order to speed up tests made
repeteadly in a distribution. It also deletes from the destination
files which do not appear any longer in the sources, and tries not to
copy files which will eventually be generated or deleted prior to
compilation.

   After that, the `SETTINGS' file is updated to reflect the new
location, the sources are cleaned up, and a regular compilation is
started.

179 A Chart Library
*******************

*Author(s):* Isabel Marti'n Garci'a.

   This library is intended to eaose the task of displaying some
graphical results. This library allows the programmer to visualize
different graphs and tables without knowing anything about specific
graphical packages.

   You need to install the BLT package in your computer. BLT is an
extension to the Tk toolkit and it does not require any patching of
the Tcl or Tk source files. You can find it in
`http://www.tcltk.com/blt/index.html'

   Basically, when the user invokes a predicate, the library
(internally) creates a bltwish interpreter and passes the information
through a socket to display the required widget. The interpreter
parses the received commands and executes them.

   The predicates exported by this library can be classified in four
main groups, according to the types of representation they provide.

   * bar charts

   * line graphs

   * scatter graphs

   * tables

   To represent graphs, the Cartesian coordinate system is used. I
have tried to show simple samples for every library exported
predicate in order to indicate how to call them.

179.1 Bar charts
================

In this section we shall introduce the general issues about the set
of barchart predicates. By calling the predicates that pertain to
this group a bar chart for plotting two-dimensional data (X-Y
coordinates) can be created. A bar chart is a graphic means of
comparing numbers by displaying bars of lengths proportional to the
y-coordinates they represented. The barchart widget has many
configurable options such as title, header text, legend and so on.
You can configure the appearance of the bars as well. The bar chart
widget has the following components:

Header text
     The text displayed at the top of the window. If it is `''' no
     text will be displayed.

Save button
     The button placed below the header text. Pops up a dialog box
     for the user to select a file to save the graphic in PostScript
     format.(1)

Bar chart title
     The title of the graph. It is displayed at the top of the bar
     chart graph. If text is `''' no title will be displayed.

X axis title
     X axis title. If text is `''' no x axis title will be displayed.

Y axis title
     Y axis title. If text is `''' no y axis title will be displayed.

X axis
     X coordinate axis. The x axis is drawn at the bottom margin of
     the bar chart graph. The x axis consists of the axis line, ticks
     and tick labels. Tick labels can be numbers or plain text. If
     the labels are numbers, they could be displayed at uniform
     intervals (the numbers are treated as normal text) or depending
     on its x-coodinate value. You can also set limits (maximum and
     minimum) for the x axis, but only if the tick labels are numeric.

Y axis
     Y coordinate axis. You can set limits (maximum and minimum) for
     the y axis. The y axis is drawn at the right margin of the bar
     chart graph.The y axis consists of the axis line, ticks and tick
     labels. The tick labels are numeric values determined from the
     data and are drawn at uniform intervals.

Bar chart graph
     This is the plotting area, placed in the center of the window
     and surrounded by the axes, the axis titles and the legend (if
     any). The range of the axes controls what region of the data is
     plotted. By default, the minimum and maximum limits are
     determined from the data, but you can set them (as mentioned
     before). Data points outside the minimum and maximum value of
     the axes are not plotted.

Legend
     The legend displays the name and symbol of each bar. The legend
     is placed in the right margin of the Bar chart graph.

Footer text
     Text displayed at the lower part of the window. If text is `'''
     no header text will be displayed.

Quit button
     Button placed below the footer text. Click it to close the
     window.


   All of them are arranged in a window. However you can, for
example, show a bar chart window without legend or header text. Other
configuration options will be explained later.

   In addition to the window appearance there is another important
issue about the bar chart window, namely its behaviour in response to
user actions. The association user actions to response is called
_bindings_. The main bindings currently specified are the following:

Default bindings
     Those are well known by most users. They are related to the
     frame displayed around the window. As you know, you can
     interactively move, resize, close, iconify, deiconify, send to
     another desktop etc. a window.

Bindings related to bar chart graph and its legend
     Clicking the left mouse key over a legend element, the
     corresponding bar turns out into red. After clicking again, the
     bar toggles to its original look. In addition, you can do
     zoom-in by pressing the left mouse key over the bar chart graph
     and dragging to select an area. To zoom out simply press the
     right mouse button.

     When the pointer passes over the plotting area the cross hairs
     are drawn. The cross hairs consists of two intersecting lines
     (one vertical and one horizontal). Besides, if the pointer is
     over a legend element, its background changes.

Bindings related to buttons
     There are two buttons in the main widget. Clicking the mouse on
     the Save button a "Save as" dialog box is popped up. The user
     can select a file to save the graph. If the user choose a file
     that already exists, the dialog box prompts the user for
     confirmation on whether the existing file should be overwritten
     or not. Furthermore, you can close the widget by clicking on the
     Quit button.

     When the pointer passes over a button the button color changes.


   The predicates that belong to this group are those whose names
begin with *barchart* and *genmultibar*. If you take a look at the
predicate names that pertain to this group, you will notice that they
are not self-explanatory. It would have been better to name the
predicates in a way that allows the user to identify the predicate
features by its name, but it would bring about very long names (i.e
barchart_WithoutLegend_BarsAtUniformIntervals_RandomBarsColors). For
this reason I decided to simply add a number after barchart to name
them.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Limitation: Some printers can have problems if the PostScript
file is too complex (i.e. too many points/lines appear in the
picture).

179.2 Line graphs
=================

It is frequently the case that several datasets need to be displayed
on the same plot. If so, you may wish to distinguish the points in
different datasets by joining them by lines of different color, or by
plotting with symbols of different types. This set of predicates
allows the programmer to represent two-dimensional data (X-Y
coordinates). Each dataset contains x and y vectors containing the
coordinates of the data. You can configure the appearance of the
points and the lines which the points are connected with. The
configurable line graph components are:

line graph
     This is the plotting area, placed in the center of the window
     and surrounded by the axes, the axes titles and the legend (if
     any). The range of the axes controls what region of the data is
     plotted. By default, the minimum and maximum limits are
     determined from the data, but you can set them. Data points
     outside the minimum and maximum value of the axes are not
     plotted. You can specify how connecting line segments joining
     successive datapoints are drawn by setting the `Smooth'
     argument. Smooth can be either linear, step, natural and
     quadratic. Furthermore, you can select the appearance of the
     points and lines.

Legend
     The legend displays the name and symbol of each line. The legend
     is placed in the right margin of the graph.


   The elements header, footer, quit and save buttons, the titles and
the axes are quite similar to those in barchart graphs, except in
that the tick labels will be numbers. All of them are arranged in a
window by the geometry manager. However you can, as we mentioned in
the above paragraphs, show a line graph window without any titles or
footer text. Other configuration options will be explained later in
this section or in the corresponding modules.

   Related to the behaviour of the widgets in response to user
actions (bindings) we will remark the following features:

Bindings related to line graph and its legend
     Clicking the left mouse key over a legend element, the
     corresponding line turns out into blue. Repeating the action
     reverts the line to its original color. Moreover, you can do
     zoom-in by clicking the left mouse key over the bar chart graph
     and dragging a rectangle defining the area you want to zoom in.
     To zoom out simply press the right mouse button.

     When the pointer passes over the plotting area the cross hairs
     are drawn. The cross hairs consists of two intersecting lines
     (one vertical and one horizontal). Besides, if the pointer is
     over a legend element, its background changes.

Other bindings
     The default bindings and the bindings related to the save and
     quit buttons are similar to those in the bar chart graphs.


   The predicates that belong to this group are those whose names
begin with *graph_*.

179.3 Scatter graphs
====================

The challenge of this section is to introduce some general aspects
about the scatter graph predicates group. By invoking the scatter
graph predicates the user can represent two-dimensional point
datasets. Often you need to display one or several point datasets on
the same plot. If so, you may wish to distinguish the points that
pertain to different datasets by using plotting symbols of different
types, or by displaying them in different colors. This set of
predicates allows you to represent two-dimensional data (X-Y
coordinates). Each dataset contains x and y vectors containing the
coordinates of the data. You can configure the appearance of the
points. The configurable scatter graph components are:

scatter graph
     This is the plotting area, placed in the center of the window
     and surrounded by the axes, the axes titles and the legend (if
     any). The range of the axes controls what region of the data is
     plotted. By default, the minimum and maximum limits are
     determined from the data, but you can set them (as we mentioned
     before). Data points outside the minimum and maximum value of
     the axes are not plotted. The user can select the appearance of
     the points.

Legend
     The legend displays the name and symbol of each point dataset.
     The legend is drawn in the right margin of the graph.


   The elements header, footer, quit and save buttons, the titles and
the axes are similar to those in barchart graphs except for that, as
in line graphs, the tick labels will be numbers. All of them are
arranged in a window by the geometry manager. However you can, for
example, show a scatter graph window without titles or footer text,
as we mentioned before. Other configuration options will be explained
later, in the corresponding modules.

   Related to the behaviour of the widgets in response to user
actions (bindings) the following features are:

Bindings related to scatter graph and its legend
     Clicking the left mouse key over a legend element, the points
     which belong to the corresponding dataset turn out into blue.
     Repeating the action toggles the point dataset to its original
     color. Moreover, you can do zoom-in by clicking the left mouse
     key over the bar chart graph and dragging a rectangle defining
     the area you want to zoom-in on. To do zoom-out simply press the
     right mouse button.

     When the pointer passes over the plotting area the cross hairs
     are drawn. The cross hairs consists of two intersecting lines
     (one vertical and one horizontal). Besides, if the pointer is
     over a legend element, its background changes.

Other bindings
     The default bindings and the bindings related to the save and
     quit buttons are similar to those in the bar chart graphs.


   The predicates that belong to this group are those whose names
began with *scattergraph_*.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Tables,  Next: Overview of widgets,  Prev: Scatter graphs,  Up: A Chart Library

179.4 Tables
============

The purpose of this section is to allow the user to display results
in a table. A table is a regular structure in which:

   * Every row has the same number of columns, or

   * Every column has the same number of rows.


   The widget configurable components are as follows:

Title
     Title of the widget, it is displayed centered at the top of the
     canvas. If text is `''' no title will be displayed.

Header text
     Left centered text displayed bellow the title. If text is `'''
     no header text will be displayed.

Table
     Is placed in the center of the window. The table is composed by
     cells ordered in rows and columns. The cell values can be either
     any kind of text or numbers and they can be empty as well (see
     the type definition in the corresponding chapter module). A
     table is a list of lists. Each sublist is a row, so every
     sublist in the table must contain the same number of alements.

Footer text
     Left centered text displayed at the lower part of the window. If
     text is `''' no header text will be displayed.

Quit button
     Button placed below the footer text. You can click it to close
     the window.


   If the arguments are not in a correct format an exception will be
thrown. Moreover, these widgets have the default bindings and the
binding related to the quit button:

   The set of predicates that belongs to this group are those which
names begin with *table_widget*.

179.5 Overview of widgets
=========================

Although you don't have to worry about how to arrange the widgets,
here is an overview of how Tcl-tk, the underlying graphical system
currently used by chartlib, performs this task. Quoting from the book
_Tcl and Tk toolkit_, John K. Ousterhout.

   The X Window System provides many facilities for manipulating
windows in displays. The root window may have any number of child
windows, each of wich is called a top-level window. Top-level windows
may have children of their own, wich may have also children, and so
on. The descendants of top-level windows are called internal windows.
Internal windows are usedfor individual controls such as buttons,
text entries, and for grouping controls together. An X-application
tipically manages several top-level windows. Tk uses X to implement a
set of controls with the Motif look and feel. These controls are
called widgets. Each widget is implemented using one X window, and
the terms "window" and "widget" will be used interchangeably in this
document. As with windows, widgets are nested in hierarchical
structures. In this library top-level widgets (nonleaf or main) are
just containers for organizing and arranging the leaf widgets
(components). Thereby, the barchart widget is a top-level window wich
contains some widget components.

   Probably the most painstaking aspect of building a graphical
application is getting the placement and size of the widgets just
right. It usually takes many iterations to align widgets and adjust
their spacing. That's because managing the geometry of widgets is
simply not a packing problem, but also graphical design problem.
Attributes such as alignment, symmetry, and balance are more
important than minimizing the amount of space used for packing. Tk is
similar to other X toolkits in that it does not allow widgets to
determine their own geometries. A widget will not even appeared
unless it is managed by a geometry manager. This separation of
geometry management from internal widget behaviour allows multiple
geometry managers to exist simultaneously and permits any widget to
be used with any geometry manager. A geometry manager's job is to
arrange one or more _slave_ widgets relative to a _master_ widgets.
There are some geometry managers in Tk such as pack, place and canvas
widget. We will use another one call table.

   The table geometry manager arranges widgets in a table. It's easy
to align widgets (horizontally and vertically) or to create empty
space to balance the arrangement of the widgets. Widgets (called
slaves in the Tk parlance) are arranged inside a containing widget
(called the master). Widgets are positioned at row,column locations
and may span any number of rows or columns. More than one widget can
occupy a single location. The placement of widget windows determines
both the size and arrangement of the table. The table queries the
requested size of each widget. The requested size of a widget is the
natural size of the widget (before the widget is shrunk or expanded).
The height of each row and the width of each column is the largest
widget spanning that row or column. The size of the table is in turn
the sum of the row and column sizes. This is the table's normal size.
The total number of rows and columns in a table is determined from
the indices specified. The table grows dynamically as windows are
added at larger indices.

 -- PREDICATE: new_interp/1:
     `new_interp(Interp)'

     Creates a bltwish interprter and returns a socket. The socket
     allows the comunication between Prolog and Tcl-tk. Thus, bltwish
     receives the commands through the socket.

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Interp' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          bltclass:bltwish_interp(Interp)  (bltclass:bltwish_interp/1)


 -- PREDICATE: tcltk_raw_code/2:
     `tcltk_raw_code(Command_Line,Interp)'

     Sends a command line to the interpreter. Tcl-tk parses and
     executes it.

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Command_Line' is a string (a list of character codes).
          (basic_props:string/1)

 -- REGTYPE: bltwish_interp/1:
     `bltwish_interp(Interp)'

     This type defines a bltwish interpreter. In fact, the bltwish
     interpreter receives the commands through the socket created.

181 Error Handler for Chartlib
******************************

*Author(s):* Isabel Marti'n Garci'a.

   This module is an error handler. If the format of the arguments is
not correct in a call to a chartlib predicate an exception will be
thrown . You can wrap the chartlib predicates with the predicates
exported by this module to handle automatically the errors if any.

 -- PREDICATE: chartlib_text_error_protect/1:
     `chartlib_text_error_protect(G)'

     This predicate catches the thrown exception and sends it to the
     appropiate handler. The handler will show the error message in
     the standard output.

     _Meta-predicate_ with arguments:
     `chartlib_text_error_protect(goal)'.

183 Barchart widgets - 1
************************

*Author(s):* Isabel Marti'n Garci'a.

   This module defines predicates to show barchart widgets. The three
predicates exported by this module plot two-variable data as regular
bars in a window. They all share the following features:

   * No numeric values for the `x' axis are needed because they will
     be interpreted as labels. See `xbarelement1/1' definition type.

   * The bars will be displayed at uniform intervals.

   * The user can either select the appearance of the bars
     (background color, foreground color and stipple style) or not.
     See the `xbarelement1' type definition. Thus, the user can call
     each predicate in two ways.

   * The bar chart has a legend. One entry (symbol and label) per bar.

   * If you don't want to display text in the elements header,
     barchart title, x axis title, y axis title or footer, simply
     type `''' as the value of the argument.

   * The predicates test whether the format of the arguments is
     correct. If one or both vectors are empty, the exception
     `error2' will be thrown. If the vectors contains elements but
     are not correct, the exception `error1' or `error3' will be
     thrown, depending on the error type. `error1' means that
     `XVector' and `YVector' do not contain the same number of
     elements and `error3' indicates that not all the `XVector'
     elements contain a correct number of attributes .


Particular features will be pointed out in the corresponding
predicate.

==========================================

 -- PREDICATE: barchart1/7:
     `barchart1(Header,BarchartTitle,XTitle,XVector,YTitle,YVector,Footer)'

     The `y' axis range is determined from the limits of the data.
     Two examples are given to demonstrate clearly how to call the
     predicates. In the first example the user sets the bar
     appearance, in the second one the appearance features will be
     chosen by the system and the colors that have been assigned to
     the variables Color1, Color2 and Pattern will be shown also.

     Example 1:

          barchart1('This is the header text',
            'Barchart title',
            'xaxistitle',
            [ ['bar1','legend_element1','Blue','Yellow','pattern1'],
                     ['bar2','legend_element2','Plum','SeaGreen','pattern2'],
                     ['bar3','legend_element3','Turquoise','Yellow',
          	    'pattern5'] ],
            'yaxixtitle',
            [20,10,59],
            'footer').

     Example 2:

          barchart1('This is the header text',
            'Barchart title',
            'xaxistitle',
            [ ['element1','legend_element1',Color1,Color2,Pattern],
                      ['element2','legend_element2'],
                      ['element3','legend_element3'] ],
            'yaxixtitle',
            [20,10,59],
            'footer').

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Header' is a text (an atom) describing the header of the
          graph.   (genbar1:header/1)

          `BarchartTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label,
          usually not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `XTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually
          not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `XVector' is a list of `xbarelement1's.
          (basic_props:list/2)

          `YTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually
          not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `YVector' is a list of `yelement's.   (basic_props:list/2)

          `Footer' is a text (an atom) describing the footer of the
          graph.   (genbar1:footer/1)


 -- PREDICATE: barchart1/9:
     `barchart1(Header,BTitle,XTitle,XVector,YTitle,YVector,YMax,YMin,Footer)'

     You can set the minimum and maximum limits of the `y' axis. Data
     outside the limits will not be plotted. Each limit, as you can
     check by looking at the `axis_limit/1' definition, is a number.
     If the argument is a variable the limit will be calculated from
     the data (i.e., if `YMax' value is YValueMax the maximum y axis
     limit will calculated using the largest data value).

     Example:

          barchart1('This is the header text',
            'Barchart title',
            'xaxistitle',
            [ ['element1','e1','Blue','Yellow','pattern1'],
                ['element2','e2','Turquoise','Plum','pattern5'],
                ['element3','e3','Turquoise','Green','pattern5'] ],
            'yaxixtitle',
            [20,10,59],
            70,
            _,
            'footer').

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Header' is a text (an atom) describing the header of the
          graph.   (genbar1:header/1)

          `BTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually
          not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `XTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually
          not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `XVector' is a list of `xbarelement1's.
          (basic_props:list/2)

          `YTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually
          not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `YVector' is a list of `yelement's.   (basic_props:list/2)

          genbar1:axis_limit(YMax)  (genbar1:axis_limit/1)

          genbar1:axis_limit(YMin)  (genbar1:axis_limit/1)

          `Footer' is a text (an atom) describing the footer of the
          graph.   (genbar1:footer/1)


 -- PREDICATE: percentbarchart1/7:
     `percentbarchart1(Header,BTitle,XTitle,XVector,YTitle,YVector,Footer)'

     The y axis maximum coordinate value is 100. The `x' axis limits
     are automatically worked out.

     Example:

          percentbarchart1('This is a special barchart to represent percentages',
            'Barchart with legend',
            'My xaxistitle',
            [ [1,'bar1','Blue','Yellow','pattern1'],
                 [8,'bar2','MediumTurquoise','Plum','pattern5'] ],
            'My yaxixtitle',
            [80,10],
            'This is the footer text').

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Header' is a text (an atom) describing the header of the
          graph.   (genbar1:header/1)

          `BTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually
          not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `XTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually
          not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `XVector' is a list of `xbarelement1's.
          (basic_props:list/2)

          `YTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually
          not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `YVector' is a list of `yelement's.   (basic_props:list/2)

          `Footer' is a text (an atom) describing the footer of the
          graph.   (genbar1:footer/1)


 -- REGTYPE: yelement/1:
          yelement(Y) :-
                  number(Y).

     Y is the bar lenght, so it must be a numeric value.

     Both Prolog and Tcl-Tk support integers and floats. Integers are
     usually specified in decimal, but if the first character is 0
     the number is read in octal (base 8), and if the first two
     characters are 0x, the number is read in hexadecimal (base16).
     Float numbers may be specified using most of the forms defined
     for ANSI C, including the following examples:

        * 9.56

        * 5.88e-2

        * 5.1E2

     Note: Be careful when using floats. While 8. or 7.e4 is
     interpreted by Tcl-tk as 8.0 and 7.0e4, Prolog will not read
     them as float numbers. Example:
                  ?- number(8.e+5).
                  {SYNTAX ERROR: (lns 130-130) , or ) expected in arguments

     Precision: Tcl-tk internally represents integers with the C type
     `int', which provides at least 32 bits of precision on most
     machines. Since Prolog integers can (in some implementations)
     exceed 32 bits but the precision in Tcl-tk depends on the
     machine, it is up to the progammer to ensure that the values fit
     into the maximum precision of the machine for integers. Real
     numbers are represented with the C type `double', which is
     usually represented with 64-bit values (about 15 decimal digits
     of precision) using the IEEE Floating Point Standard.

     Conversion: If the list is composed by integers and floats,
     Tcl-tk will convert integers to floats.



 -- REGTYPE: axis_limit/1:
          axis_limit(X) :-
                  number(X).
          axis_limit(_1).

     This type is defined in order to set the minimum and maximum
     limits of the axes. Data outside the limits will not be plotted.
     Each limit, is a number or a variable. If the argument is not a
     number the limit will be calculated from the data (i.e., if YMax
     value is `Var' the maximum y axis limit will be calculated using
     the largest data value).



 -- REGTYPE: header/1:
     *Usage:* `header(X)'
        - _Description:_ `X' is a text (an atom) describing the
          header of the graph.


 -- REGTYPE: title/1:
     *Usage:* `title(X)'
        - _Description:_ `X' is a text (an atom) to be used as label,
          usually not very long.


 -- REGTYPE: footer/1:
     *Usage:* `footer(X)'
        - _Description:_ `X' is a text (an atom) describing the
          footer of the graph.

     Defines the attributes of the bar.
    `XValue'
          bar label. Although `XValue' values may be numbers, the
          will be treated as labels. Different elements with the same
          label will produce different bars.

    `LegendElement'
          Legend element name. It may be a number or an atom and
          equal or different to the XValue. Every `LegendElement'
          value of the list must be unique.

    `ForegColor'
          It sets the Foreground color of the bar. Its value must be
          a valid color, otherwise the system will throw an
          exception. If the argument value is a variable, it gets
          instantiated to a color chosen by the library.

    `BackgColor'
          It sets the Background color of the bar. Its value must be
          a valid color, otherwise the system will throw an
          exception. If the argument value is a variable, it gets
          instantiated to a color chosen by the library.

    `SPattern'
          It sets the stipple of the bar. Its value must be a valid
          pattern, otherwise the system will throw an exception. If
          the argument value is a variable, it gets instantiated to a
          pattern chosen by the library.

************************

*Author(s):* Isabel Marti'n Garci'a.

   This module defines predicates which show barchart widgets. The
three predicates exported by this module plot two-variable data as
regular bars in a window. They all share the following features:

   * Numeric values for the x axis are needed, otherwise it does not
     work properly. See `xbarelement2/1' definition type.

   * The bar position is proportional to the x-coordinate value.

   * The user can either select the appearance of the bars
     (background color, foreground color and stipple style) or not.
     See the `xbarelement2/1' type definition. Thus, the user can
     call each predicate in two ways.

   * The bar chart has a legend and one entry (symbol and label) per
     bar.

   * If you do not want to display text in the elements header,
     barchart title, x axis title, y axis title or footer, simply
     type `''' as the value of the argument.

   * The predicates test whether the format of the arguments is
     correct. If one or both vectors are empty, the exception
     `error2' will be thrown. If the vectors contain elements but are
     not correct, the exception `error1' or `error3' will be thrown,
     depending on the error type. `error1' means that `XVector' and
     `YVector' does not contain the same number of elements and
     `error3' indicates that not all the `XVector' elements contain a
     correct number of attributes .


   Particular features will be pointed out in the corresponding
predicate.

==========================================

 -- PREDICATE: barchart2/7:
     `barchart2(Header,BarchartTitle,XTitle,XVector,YTitle,YVector,Footer)'

     The maximum and minimum limits for axes are determined from the
     data.

     Example:

          barchart2('This is the header text',
            'Barchart with legend',
            'My xaxistitle',
            [ [1,'bar1','Blue','Yellow','pattern1'],
                 [2,'bar2','MediumTurquoise','Plum','pattern5'] ],
            'My yaxixtitle',
            [20,10],
            'This is the footer text').

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Header' is a text (an atom) describing the header of the
          graph.   (genbar1:header/1)

          `BarchartTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label,
          usually not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `XTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually
          not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `XVector' is a list of `xbarelement2's.
          (basic_props:list/2)

          `YTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually
          not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `YVector' is a list of `yelement's.   (basic_props:list/2)

          `Footer' is a text (an atom) describing the footer of the
          graph.   (genbar1:footer/1)


 -- PREDICATE: barchart2/11:
     `barchart2(Header,BT,XT,XVector,XMax,XMin,YT,YVector,YMax,YMin,Footer)'

     You can set the minimum and maximum limits of the axes. Data
     outside the limits will not be plotted. Each limit, as you can
     check looking at the `axis_limit/1' definition, is a number. If
     the argument is a variable the limit will be calculated from the
     data (i.e., if `YMax' value is YValueMax the maximum y axis
     limit will calculated using the largest data value).

     Example:

          barchart2('This is the header text',
            'Barchart with legend',
            'My xaxistitle',
            [ [1,'bar1',Color1,Color2,Pattern1],
                   [2,'bar2',Color3,Color4,Pattern2] ],
            10,
            -10,
            'My yaxixtitle',
            [20,10],
            100,
            -10,
            'The limits for the axes are set by the user').

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Header' is a text (an atom) describing the header of the
          graph.   (genbar1:header/1)

          very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `XT' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually not
          very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `XVector' is a list of `xbarelement2's.
          (basic_props:list/2)

          genbar1:axis_limit(XMax)  (genbar1:axis_limit/1)

          genbar1:axis_limit(XMin)  (genbar1:axis_limit/1)

          `YT' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually not
          very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `Footer' is a text (an atom) describing the footer of the
          graph.   (genbar1:footer/1)


 -- PREDICATE: percentbarchart2/7:
     `percentbarchart2(Header,BTitle,XTitle,XVector,YTitle,YVector,Footer)'

     The y axis maximum coordinate value is 100. The x axis limits
     are autoarrange.

     Example:

          percentbarchart2('This is a special barchart to represent percentages',
            'Barchart with legend',
            'My xaxistitle',
            [ [1,'bar1','Blue','Yellow','pattern1'],
                    [2,'bar2','MediumTurquoise','Plum','pattern5'] ],
            'My yaxixtitle',
            [80,10],
            'This is the footer text').

          `YVector' is a list of `yelement's.   (basic_props:list/2)

          `Footer' is a text (an atom) describing the footer of the
          graph.   (genbar1:footer/1)


 -- REGTYPE: xbarelement2/1:
          xbarelement2([XValue,LegendElement]) :-
                  number(XValue),
                  atomic(LegendElement).

     Defines the attributes of the bar.

    `XValue'
          x-coordinate position of the bar. Different elements with
          the same abscissas will produce overlapped bars.

    `LegendElement'
          Element legend name. It may be a number or an atom and

          value of the list must be unique.

    `ForegColor'
          Is the Foreground color of the bar. Its value must be a
          valid color, otherwise the system will throw an exception.
          If the argument value is a variable, it gets instantiated
          to a color chosen by the library.

    `BackgColor'
          Is the Background color of the bar. Its value must be a
          valid color, otherwise the system will throw an exception.
          If the argument value is a variable, it gets instantiated
          to a color chosen by the library.

    `SPattern'
          Is the stipple of the bar. Its value must be a valid
          pattern, otherwise the system will throw an exception. If
          the argument value is a variable, it gets instantiated to a

   This module defines predicates which depict barchart widgets. The
three predicates exported by this module plot two-variable data as
regular bars in a window and are similar to those exported in the
genbar1 module except in that these defined in this module do not
display a legend. Thus, not all the argument types are equal.

   The predicates test whether the format of the arguments is
correct. If one or both vectors are empty, the exception `error2'
will be thrown. If the vectors contain elements but are not correct,
the exception `error1' or `error3' will be thrown, depending on the
error type. `error1' means that `XVector' and `YVector' do not
contain the same number of elements and `error3' indicates that not
all the `XVector' elements contain a correct number of attributes .

==========================================

 -- PREDICATE: barchart3/7:
     `barchart3(Header,BarchartTitle,XTitle,XVector,YTitle,YVector,Footer)'

     As we mentioned in the above paragraph, this predicate is
     comparable to `barchart1/8' except in the `XVector' argument
     type.

     Example:
          barchart3('This is the header text',
            'Barchart without legend',
            'My xaxistitle',
            [['bar1'],['bar2']],
            'My yaxixtitle',
            [20,10],
            'This is the footer text').

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Header' is a text (an atom) describing the header of the
          graph.   (genbar1:header/1)

          `BarchartTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label,
          usually not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `XTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually
          not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `XVector' is a list of `xbarelement3's.
          (basic_props:list/2)

          `YTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually

          `YVector' is a list of `yelement's.   (basic_props:list/2)

          `Footer' is a text (an atom) describing the footer of the

 -- PREDICATE: barchart3/9:
     `barchart3(Header,BTitle,XTitle,XVector,YTitle,YVector,YMax,YMin,Footer)'

     As we mentioned, this predicate is quite similar to the `barchart1/10'
     except in the `XVector' argument type, because the yielded bar
     chart lacks of legend.

     Example:
          barchart3('This is the header text',
            'Barchart without legend',
            'My xaxistitle',
            [['bar1'],['bar2']],

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Header' is a text (an atom) describing the header of the
          graph.   (genbar1:header/1)

          `BTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually
          not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `XTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually
          not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `XVector' is a list of `xbarelement3's.
          (basic_props:list/2)

          `YTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually
          not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `YVector' is a list of `yelement's.   (basic_props:list/2)

          genbar1:axis_limit(YMax)  (genbar1:axis_limit/1)

          genbar1:axis_limit(YMin)  (genbar1:axis_limit/1)

          `Footer' is a text (an atom) describing the footer of the
          graph.   (genbar1:footer/1)


 -- PREDICATE: percentbarchart3/7:
     `percentbarchart3(Header,BTitle,XTitle,XVector,YTitle,YVector,Footer)'

     The `y' axis maximum coordinate value is 100. The x axis limits
     are autoarrange.

     Example:

          percentbarchart3('This is a special barchart to represent percentages',
                    'Barchart without legend',
                    'My xaxistitle',

                    [80,10],
                    'This is the footer text').

186 Depict barchart widgets - 4
*******************************

*Author(s):* Isabel Marti'n Garci'a.

   This module defines predicates which depict barchart widgets. The
three predicates exported by this module plot two-variable data as
regular bars in a window and are similar to those exported in genbar2
module except in that those defined in this module doesn't display a
legend. Thus, the user does not have to define legend element names.

   The predicates test whether the format of the arguments is
correct. If one or both vectors are empty, the exception `error2'
will be thrown. If the vectors contains elements but are not correct,
the exception `error1' or `error3' will be thrown, depending on the
error type. `error1' means that `XVector' and `YVector' do not
contain the same number of elements and `error3' indicates that not
all the `XVector' elements contain a correct number of attributes .

186.2 Documentation on exports (`genbar4')
==========================================

 -- PREDICATE: barchart4/7:
     `barchart4(Header,BarchartTitle,XTitle,XVector,YTitle,YVector,Footer)'

     As we mentioned in the above paragraph, this predicate is
     comparable to `barchart2/8' except in the `XVector' argument
     type.

     Example:
          barchart4('This is the header text',
            'Barchart without legend',
            'My xaxistitle',
            [[2],[5],[6]],
            'My yaxixtitle',
            [20,10,59],
            'Numeric values in the xaxis').

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Header' is a text (an atom) describing the header of the
          graph.   (genbar1:header/1)

          `BarchartTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label,
          usually not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `XTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually
          not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `XVector' is a list of `xbarelement4's.
          (basic_props:list/2)

          `YTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually
          not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `YVector' is a list of `yelement's.   (basic_props:list/2)

          `Footer' is a text (an atom) describing the footer of the
          graph.   (genbar1:footer/1)


 -- PREDICATE: barchart4/11:
     `barchart4(Hder,BT,XT,XVector,XMax,XMin,YT,YVector,YMax,YMin,Fter)'

     As we stated before, this predicate is quite similar to `barchart2/10'
     except in the following aspects:

        * The `XVector' argument type, because the yielded bar chart
          lacks the legend.

        * The user can set limits for both `x' axis and `y' axis.


     Example:
          barchart4('This is the header text, you can write a graph description',
            'Barchart without legend',
            'My xaxistitle',
            [[2,'Blue','Yellow','pattern1'],
                 [20,'MediumTurquoise','Plum','pattern5'],
                 [30,'MediumTurquoise','Green','pattern5']],
            50,
            -10,
            'My yaxixtitle',
            [20,10,59],
            100,
            -10,
            'Numeric values in the xaxis').

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Hder' is a text (an atom) describing the header of the
          graph.   (genbar1:header/1)

          `BT' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually not
          very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `XT' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually not
          very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `XVector' is a list of `xbarelement4's.
          (basic_props:list/2)

          genbar1:axis_limit(XMax)  (genbar1:axis_limit/1)

          genbar1:axis_limit(XMin)  (genbar1:axis_limit/1)

          `YT' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually not
          very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `YVector' is a list of `yelement's.   (basic_props:list/2)

          genbar1:axis_limit(YMax)  (genbar1:axis_limit/1)

          genbar1:axis_limit(YMin)  (genbar1:axis_limit/1)

          `Fter' is a text (an atom) describing the footer of the
          graph.   (genbar1:footer/1)


 -- PREDICATE: percentbarchart4/7:
     `percentbarchart4(Header,BTitle,XTitle,XVector,YTitle,YVector,Footer)'

     The y axis maximum coordinate value is 100. The x axis limits
     are automatically worked out. This predicate is useful when the
     bar height represents percentages.

     Example:

          percentbarchart4('This is the header text',
            'Barchart without legend',
            'My xaxistitle',
            [[2,'Blue','Yellow','pattern1'],[5,'Yellow','Plum','pattern5'],
                 [6,'MediumTurquoise','Green','pattern5']],
            'My yaxixtitle',
            [20,10,59],
            'Numeric values in the xaxis').

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Header' is a text (an atom) describing the header of the
          graph.   (genbar1:header/1)

          `BTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually
          not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `XTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually
          not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `XVector' is a list of `xbarelement4's.
          (basic_props:list/2)

          `YTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually
          not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `YVector' is a list of `yelement's.   (basic_props:list/2)

============================================

 -- REGTYPE: xbarelement4/1:
     Defines the attributes of the bar.
    `XValue'
          x-coordinate position of the bar. Different elements with
          the same abscissas will produce overlapped bars.

    `ForegColor'
          It sets the Foreground color of the bar. Its value must be
          a valid color, otherwise the system will throw an
          exception. If the argument value is a variable, it gets
          instantiated to a color chosen by the library.

    `BackgColor'
          It sets the Background color of the bar. Its value must be
          a valid color, otherwise the system will throw an
          exception. If the argument value is a variable, it gets
          instantiated to a color chosen by the library.

    `SPattern'
          It sets the stipple of the bar. Its value must be a valid
          pattern, otherwise the system will throw an exception. If
          the argument value is a variable, it gets instantiated to a
          pattern chosen by the library.

187 Depic line graph
********************

*Author(s):* Isabel Marti'n Garci'a.

   This module defines predicates which depict line graph and scatter
graph widgets. All eigth predicates exported by this module plot
two-variable data. Each point is defined by its X-Y coordinate
values. A dataset is defined by two lists xvector and yvector, which
contain the points coordinates. As you might guess, the values placed
in the the same position in both lists are the coordinates of a
point. They both share the following features:

   * Numeric values for vector elements are needed. We'll use two
     vectors to represent the X-Y coordinates of each set of plotted
     data, but in this case every dataset shares the X-vector, i.e.,
     x-coordinate of points with the same index (1) in different
     datasets is the same. Thus, the numbers of points in each
     yvector must be equal to the number of points in the xvector.

   * The active element color is navyblue, which means that when you
     select a legend element, the corresponding line or point dataset
     turns into navyblue.

   * The user can either select the appearance of the lines and/or
     points of each dataset or not. If not, the system will choose
     the colors for the lines and the points among the available ones
     in accordance with the plot background color and it will also
     set the points size and symbol to the default. If the plot
     background color is black, the system will choose a lighter
     color, and the system will select a darker color when the plot
     background color is white. Thus, the user can define the
     appearanse attributes of each dataset in four different ways.
     Take a look at the `attributes/1' type definition and see the
     examples to understand it clearly.

   * The graph has a legend and one entry (symbol and label) per
     dataset.

   * If you do not want to display text in the element header,
     barchart title, xaxis title, yaxis title or footer, simply give
     `''' as the value of the argument.

   * The predicates check whether the format of the arguments is
     correct as well. The testing process involves some
     verifications. If one or both vectors are empty, the exception
     `error2' will be thrown. If the vectors contains elements but
     are not correct, the exception `error4' will be thrown.


   The names of the line graph predicates begin with *graph_* and
those corresponding to the scatter graph group begin with
*scattergraph_*.

 -- REGTYPE: vector/1:
          vector(X) :-
                  list(X,number).
     The type vector defines a list of numbers (integers or floats).



 -- REGTYPE: smooth/1:
     `smooth(Smooth)'

          smooth(linear).
          smooth(cubic).
          smooth(quadratic).
          smooth(step).

     Specifies how connecting segments are drawn between data points.
     If `Smooth' is `linear', a single line segment is drawn,
     connecting both data points. When `Smooth' is `step', two line
     segments will be drawn, the first line is a horizontal line
     segment that steps the next X-coordinate and the second one is a
     vertical line, moving to the next Y-coordinate. Both `cubic' and
     `quadratic' generate multiple segments between data points. If
     `cubic'is used, the segments are generated using a cubic spline.
     If `quadratic', a quadratic spline is used. The default is
     linear.



 -- REGTYPE: attributes/1:
          attributes([ElementName]) :-
                  atomic(ElementName).
          attributes([ElementName,OutLine,Color]) :-
                  atomic(ElementName),
                  color(OutLine),
                  color(Color).
          attributes([ElementName,Symbol,Size]) :-
                  atomic(ElementName),
                  symbol(Symbol),
                  size(Size).
          attributes([ElementName,OutLine,Color,Symbol,Size]) :-
                  atomic(ElementName),
                  color(OutLine),
                  color(Color),
                  symbol(Symbol),
                  size(Size).

     Each line or point dataset in the graph has its own attributes,
     which are defined by this type. The name of the dataset,
     specified in the `ElementName' argument, may be either a number
     or an atom. The second argument is the color of a thin line
     around each point in the dataset and the Color argument is the
     points and lines color. Both `OutLine' and `Color' must be a
     valid color (see available values in `color/1'), otherwise a
     random color according to the plot background color will be
     selected. The `Symbol' must be a valid symbol and the `Size'
     must be a number. Be careful if you want to especify the
     `Symbol' and the `Size', otherwise the predicate will not work
     as you expect. If you don't select a symbol and a size for a
     dataset the default values will be square and 1 pixel.



 -- REGTYPE: symbol/1:
     `symbol(Symbol)'

          symbol(square).
          symbol(circle).
          symbol(diamond).
          symbol(plus).
          symbol(cross).
          symbol(splus).
          symbol(scross).
          symbol(triangle).
     `Symbol' stands for the shape of the points whether in scatter
     graphs or in line graphs.



 -- REGTYPE: size/1:
     `size(Size)'

          size(Size) :-
                  number(Size).
     `Size' stands for the size in pixels of the points whether in
     scatter graphs or in line graphs.

188 Line graph widgets
**********************

*Author(s):* Isabel Marti'n Garci'a.

   This module defines predicates which show line graph widgets. All
eight predicates exported by this module plot two-variable data. Each
point is defined by its X-Y coordinate values. Every predicate share
the following features:

   * A dataset is defined by three lists xvector, yvector and
     attributes. The arguments named `XVectors' (or `XVs'),
     `YVectors' (or `YVs') and `LAtts'(1) contain this information.
     Those arguments must be lists whose elements are also lists. The
     first dataset is defined by the firts element of the three
     lists, the second dataset is defined by the second element of
     the three lists and so on.

   * Numeric values for the vector elements are needed. We will use
     two vectors to represent the X-Y coordinates of each set of data
     plotted. In these predicates the vectors can have different
     number of points. However, the number of elements in xvector and
     yvector that pertain to a certain dataset must be, obviously,
     equal.

   * The active line color is blue, which means that when you select
     a legend element, the corresponding line turns into navyblue.

   * The user can either select the appearance for the lines and the
     points or not. See the `attributes/1' type definition. Thus, the
     user can call each predicate in different ways ways.

   * The graph has a legend and one entry (symbol and label) per
     dataset.

   * If you do not want to display text in the elements header,
     barchart title, xaxis title, yaxis title or footer, simply give
     `''' as the value of the argument.

   * The predicates check whether the format of the arguments is
     correct as well. The testing process involves some
     verifications. If one or both vectors are empty, the exception
     `error2' will be thrown. If the vectors contains elements but
     are not correct, the exception `error4' will be thrown.

          genbar1:axis_limit(YMax)  (genbar1:axis_limit/1)

          genbar1:axis_limit(YMin)  (genbar1:axis_limit/1)

          `LAtts' is a list of `attributes's.   (basic_props:list/2)

 -- PREDICATE: graph_w2/9:
     `graph_w2(Header,GT,XT,XVectors,YTitle,YVectors,LAtts,Footer,Smooth)'

     This predicate is quite similar to `graph_b2/9'. The difference
     lies in the graph appearance, as you can see below.

        * The plotting area background color is white.

        * The cross hairs color is black.


     Example:

          graph_w2('This is the header text',
            'Graph_title',
            'xaxistitle',
            [[10,30,59],[25,50]],
            'yaxixtitle',
            [[10,35,40],[25,40]],
            [['element1','Blue','DarkOrchid'],['element2','DarkOliveGreen',
              'Firebrick']],
            'footer',
            'natural').

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `LAtts' is a list of `attributes's.   (basic_props:list/2)

          `Footer' is a text (an atom) describing the footer of the
          graph.   (genbar1:footer/1)

          gengraph1:smooth(Smooth)  (gengraph1:smooth/1)

     `graph_w2(Header,GT,XT,XV,XMax,XMin,YT,YVs,YMax,YMin,LAtts,Footer,Smooth)'

     This predicate is comparable to `graph_b2/13'. The differences
     lie in the plot background color and in the cross hairs color,
     wich are white and black respectively.

            'Graph_title',
            'xaxistitle',
            [[10,30,59],[10,35,40]],

            _,
            'yaxixtitle',
            [[10,35,40],[25,50,60]],
            50,
            _,
            [['element1','Blue','Green'],['element2','Turquoise','Black']],

189 Multi barchart widgets
**************************

*Author(s):* Isabel Marti'n Garci'a.

   This module defines predicates which show barchart widgets. These
bar charts are somewhat different from the bar charts generated by
the predicates in modules genbar1, genbar2, genbar3 and genbar4.
Predicates in the present module show different features of each
dataset element in one chart at the same time. Each bar chart element
is a group of bars, and the element features involve three vectors
defined as follows:

   * xvector is a list containing the names (atoms) of the bars (n
     elements). Each bar group will be displayed at uniform intervals.

   * yvector is a list that contains m sublists, each one is composed
     of n elements. The i-sublist contains the y-values of the
     i-BarAttribute element for all of the XVector elements.

   * bar_attributtes is a list containing the appearance features of
     the bars (m elements). Each element of the list can be partial
     or complete, which means that you can define as bar attributes
     only the element name or by setting the element name, its
     background and foreground color and its stipple pattern.


   Other relevant aspects about this widgets are:

   * If you don't want to display text in the elements header,
     barchart title, xaxis title, yaxis title or footer, simply type
     `''' as the value of the argument.

   * The bar chart has a legend, and one entry (symbol and label) per
     feature group bar.

   * The user can either select the appearance of the bars
     (background color, foreground color and stipple style) or not.
     See the multibar_attribute type definition.

   * Data points can have their bar segments displayed in one of the
     following modes: stacked, aligned, overlapped or overlayed. They
     user can change the mode clicking in the checkboxes associated
     to each mode.

   * The predicates test whether the format of the arguments is
     correct. If one or both vectors are empty, the exception
     `error2' will be thrown. If the vectors contains elements but
     are not correct, the exception `error5' or `error6' will be
     thrown, depending on what is incorrect. `error5' means that
     `XVector' and each element of `YVector' do not contain the same
     number of elements or that `YVector' and `BarsAtt' do not
     contain the same number of elements, while `error6' indicates
     that not all the `BarsAtt' elements contain a correct number of
     attributes.


   The examples will help you to understand how these predicates
should be called.

==============================================

 -- PREDICATE: multibarchart/8:
     `multibarchart(Header,BTitle,XTitle,XVector,YTitle,BarsAtts,YVector,Footer)'

     The x axis limits are autoarrange. The user can call the
     predicate in two ways. In the first example the user sets the
     appearance of the bars, in the second one the appearance
     features will be chosen by the library.

     Example1:
          multibarchart('This is the Header text',
          	'My BarchartTitle',
          	'Processors',
          	['processor1','processor2','processor3','processor4'],
          	'Time (seconds)',
          	[['setup time','MediumTurquoise','Plum','pattern2'],
          	    ['sleep time','Blue','Green','pattern5'],
          	    ['running time','Yellow','Plum','pattern1']],
          	[[20,30,40,50],[10,8,5,35],[60,100,20,50]],
          	'This is the Footer text').
     Example2:
          multibarchart('This is the Header text',
          	'My BarchartTitle',
          	'Processors',
          	['processor1','processor2','processor3','processor4'],
          	'Time (seconds)',
          	[['setup time'],['sleep time'],['running time']],
          	[[20,30,40,50],[10,8,5,35],[60,100,20,50]],
          	'This is the Footer text').

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Header' is a text (an atom) describing the header of the
          graph.   (genbar1:header/1)

          `BTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually
          not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `XTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually
          not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `XVector' is a list of `xelement's.   (basic_props:list/2)

          `YTitle' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually
          not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          `BarsAtts' is a list of `multibar_attribute's.
          (basic_props:list/2)

          `YVector' is a list of `yelement's.   (basic_props:list/2)

          `Footer' is a text (an atom) describing the footer of the
          graph.   (genbar1:footer/1)


 -- PREDICATE: multibarchart/10:
     `multibarchart(Header,BT,XT,XVector,YT,BAtts,YVector,YMax,YMin,Footer)'

     This predicate is quite similar to `multibarchart/8', except in
     that you can choose limits in the y axis. The part of the bars
     placed outside the limits will not be plotted.

     Example2:
          multibarchart('This is the Header text',
          	'My BarchartTitle',
          	'Processors',
          	['processor1','processor2','processor3','processor4'],
          	'Time (seconds)',
          	[['setup time'],['sleep time'],['running time']],
          	[[20,30,40,50],[10,8,5,35],[60,100,20,50]],
          	[80],
          	[0],
          	'This is the Footer text').

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Header' is a text (an atom) describing the header of the
          graph.   (genbar1:header/1)

    LegendElement
          Legend element name. It may be a number or an atom. Every
          `LegendElement' value of the list must be unique.

    `ForegroundColor'
          It sets the Foreground color of the bar. Its value must be
          a valid color, otherwise the system will throw an
          exception. If the argument value is a variable, it gets
          instantiated to a color chosen by the library.

    `BackgroundColor'
          It sets the Background color of the bar. Its value must be
          a valid color, otherwise the system will throw an
          exception. If the argument value is a variable, it gets
          instantiated to a color chosen by the library.

    `StipplePattern'
          It sets the stipple of the bar. Its value must be a valid
          pattern, otherwise the system will throw an exception. If
          the argument value is a variable, it gets instantiated to a
          pattern chosen by the library.




 -- REGTYPE: xelement/1:

 -- REGTYPE: table/1:
     A table is a list of rows, each row must contain the same number
     of elements, otherwise the table wouldn't be regular and an
     exception will be thrown by the library. The rows list may not
     be empty.
          table([X]) :-
                  row(X).
          table([X|Xs]) :-
                  row(X),
                  table(Xs).



 -- REGTYPE: image/1:
     Some predicates allow the user to set the widget background
     image, whose is what this type is intended for. The user has to
     take into account the following restrictions:

        * The image must be in gif format.

        * The file path must be absolute.

 -- PREDICATE: tablewidget2/4:
     `tablewidget2(Title,Header,ElementTable,Footer)'

     Shows a regular table in a window. The system sets a default
     background image for the widget.

     Example:
          tablewidget2('COM Features',
          	     'Extracted from "Inside COM" book ',
          	     [['Feature','Rich people','Bean Plants','C++','COM'],

          	       ['Can run for President','Yes','No','No','No']],
          	     'What do you think about COM?').

     *Usage:*
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Title' is a text (an atom) to be used as label, usually
          not very long.   (genbar1:title/1)

          graph.   (genbar1:footer/1)


 -- PREDICATE: tablewidget2/5:
     `tablewidget2(Title,Header,ElementTable,Footer,BackgroundImage)'

     This predicate and `tablewidget2/4' are quite similar, except
     that in the already one defined you must set the background
     image.

     Example:
          tablewidget2('COM Features',

   Most of the predicates exported by this module perform some checks
to determine whether the arguments attain some conditions or not. In
the second case an exception will be thrown. To catch the exceptions
you can use the following metapredicates when invoking chartlib
exported predicates:

   * `chartlib_text_error_protect/1'

   * `chartlib_text_error_protect/1'


   Both metapredicates are defined in the chartlib_errhandle module
that comes with this library. Some of the predicates have a
`Predicate' argument which will be used in case of error to show
which chartlib predicate causes the error.

195 Doubly linked lists
***********************

*Author(s):* David Trallero Mena.

   This library implements "doubly linked" lists, in the sense that
they can be traversed in both directions with good complexity. An
index is used for referencing the current element in the list. This
index can be modified by the _next_ and _prev_ predicates. The value
of the current index can be obtained via the _top_ predicate

197 Top-level user interface to DHT
***********************************

*Author(s):* Arsen Kostenko.

   This module contains just a top-level interface to the utilities
provided by the DHT system in Ciao. The 'philosophy' of the current
approach is that most details are hidden behind simple read/write
primitives and that the handler is exposed to the client for a
concrete DHT. By doing things this way we expect to preserve the
simplicity of DHT usage while providing the freedom of being able to
switch between various instances of the Ciao DHT system

=============================================

 -- PREDICATE: dht_server/1:
     `main/1': start the DHT server. Here is a step-by-step bahavior:
       1. set all values of `dht_config.pl' module to default.

       2. modify those, for which command-line arguments were
          supplied.

       3. modify server number separately, since it depends on two
          command-line arguments : `--server-id' and `--hash-power'.

       4. output resulting values to terminal.

       5. start client side communication by executing `dht_s2c:dht_s2c_mian/0'.

       6. start server side communication by executing `dht_s2s:dht_s2s_mian/0'.

     *Usage:* `dht_server(Arguments)'
        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Arguments' is associated with simple list, that represents
          pairs of command line arguments (argument and its value).
          Possible values are: `--join-host', `--hash-power',
          `--server-id', `--s2c-port', `--s2c-threads', `--s2s-port',
          `--s2s-threads'. All of the arguments (except
          `--join-host') accept integer values. In case of
          `--join-host' value of argument should be equal to IP/DNS
          address of host running a copy of DHT.
          (dht_server:dht_arguments_list/1)


 -- PREDICATE: dht_prolog/1:
     Another style to launch the DHT server. All the parameters are
     passed in the list. Members of the list are of type
     `prameter_name(parameter_value)', where `parameter_name'
     corresponds to name of the command line argument without two
     leading dashes (`--') and with internal dash replaced by the
     underscore (`_'). All the values are of integer type, except the
     value of `join_host', which should be an atom.

*****************************************

*Author(s):* Arsen Kostenko.

   This module describes server-2-server side behavior of any node.
Since this includes various communication and inspection tasks that
should be performed in parallel, this module makes extensive usage of
Ciao threading mechanism. On the other hand, module must be as simple
as possible in terms of usage. Therefore, only a single predicate `dht_s2s_main/0'
is exposed to outer world and rest of complexity is hidden inside.
This predicate is used from `dht_server.pl' module. All the
parameters are passed through `dht_config.pl' module.

**********************

*Author(s):* Arsen Kostenko.

   This module implements a core DHT functionality, like finger-table
manipulation and lookup search. Keep in mind that remote calls (known
as remote predicate calls in Prolog) are extracted to a separate
module as well as low-lever database handling. In turn, the logic
module is utilized by higher-lever modules, like the server-2-server
and server-2-client communication modules.

   `Id' is treated as the value of the hash function used all over
the DHT.

============================================

 -- PREDICATE: dht_init/1:
     Predicated performs the initialization of a single-node DHT.

     *Usage:* `dht_init(OwnId)'
        - _Description:_ The predicate is intended to perform various
          initialization functions like finger_table creation,
          hostname and IP address retrieval. The value supplied in
          `OwnId' is treated as value of the hash function used all
          over the DHT.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `OwnId' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)


 -- PREDICATE: dht_finger/2:
     Get the node identifier (composition of identifier and
     IP-address) by using index in the finger table. Prolog synonym
     for `finger[k].node'.

     *Usage:* `dht_finger(Idx,Finger)'
        - _Description:_ `dht_finger/2' implements the array looking
          up necessary to retrive information from the finger table,
          where first argument `Idx' if acting as array index and
          `Finger' as corresponding array value.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Idx' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Finger' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Idx' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Finger' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)


 -- PREDICATE: dht_successor/1:
     Wrapper around `dht_finger/1', where first argument is defaulted
     to '1'

     *Usage:* `dht_successor(Successor)'
        - _Description:_ `dht_successor/1' a simple wrapper around `dht_finger/2',
          that looks up the first row of so-called finger-table

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Successor' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Successor' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)


 -- PREDICATE: dht_check_predecessor/1:
     `dht_check_predecessor/1' predicate is called by external nodes
     when they run `dht_stabilize/0'. Since there is no other way to
     learn about a predecessor's failure, but checking explicitly
     once predecessor is required. that is why behavior of `dht_check_predecessor'
     is following:
       1. give 'nil' as predecessor if it is stored in database that
          way, which happens if node is unaware of any other nodes on
          the ring,

       2. otherwise, get current value of predecessor,

       3. try calling predecessor with any arbitrary predicate in our
          case `dht_successor/1',

       4. if an exception is issued by remote call - reset
          predecessor to 'nil',

       5. get value of predecessor once again and bind this value to
          the answer. We also check that in case of finger-nodes
          failure, but this would work out only in poorly populated
          Chord-ring

     *Usage 1:* `dht_check_predecessor(PredecessorId)'
        - _Description:_ Get value of predecessor for current node.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `PredecessorId' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `PredecessorId' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)

     *Usage 2:* `dht_check_predecessor(PredecessorId)'
        - _Description:_ Check whether value supplied is equal to id
          of predecessor.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `PredecessorId' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `PredecessorId' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)


 -- PREDICATE: dht_closest_preceding_finger/2:
     Perform search over current finger table, in order to find entry
     pointing to node that is more closely located to value supplied
     via `Id'. Here is original part of code from Chord paper.
            n.closest_preceding_finger(id){
                for i = m downto 1 {
                   if (finger[i].node in (n, id)){
                      return finger[i].node;
                   }
                }
                return n;
            }
     .

     *Usage:* `dht_closest_preceding_finger(Id,Finger)'
        - _Description:_ `dht_closest_preceding_finger/2' is
          searching local finger-table for the entry which points to
          a node, that is 'closer' (in terms of DHT distance) to the
          identifier specified at `Id'. It should hold that
          identifier of the node found is greater than identifier of
          current node and lesser than the identifier supplied in
          `Id'. No estimations concerning other nodes in between them
          are made. Furthermore, a cyclic structure of identifiers is
          preserved: identifier '0' is lesser then identifier '1' but
          greater then the highest identifier in DHT.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Id' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Finger' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Id' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Finger' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)


 -- PREDICATE: dht_find_predecessor/2:
     Perform search over existing DHT structure. The resulting node
     is expected to precede the one identified by `Id'. Again, a
     small quote from Chord-paper source code.
            n.find_predecessor(id){
                n' is n,
                while(id not_in (n', n'.successor] ){
                   n' = n'.closest_preceding_finger(id);
                }
                return n';
            }

     *Usage:* `dht_find_predecessor(Id,Predecessor)'
        - _Description:_ `dht_find_predecessor/2' searches all over
          DHT for a node, which is 'the closest' (in terms of DHT
          distance) to the index specified as `Id'. In other words,
          the searched node must have the index lesser than the
          identifier specified in `Id' and there must not be any
          other nodes between identifier specified in `Id' and the
          node found.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Id' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Predecessor' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Id' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Predecessor' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)


 -- PREDICATE: dht_find_successor/2:
     *Usage:* `dht_find_successor(Id,Successor)'
        - _Description:_ `dht_find_successor/2' has behavior similar
          to `dht_find_predecessor/2' except that it gives a node
          that directly succeeds the identifier specifies. In other
          words, the identifier of the node found is greater than the
          identifier specified in `Id' and there are no other nodes
          between the node found and the node specified in `Id'

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Id' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Successor' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Id' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Successor' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)


 -- PREDICATE: dht_join/1:
     It performs the join procedure on the node pointed by the
     argument. Here is the corresponding quote:
           n.join(Next){
               predecessor = nil;
               successor = Next.find_successor(n);
           }

     *Usage:* `dht_join(NodeIP)'
        - _Description:_ `dht_join/2' is executed every time some
          node decides to join some DHT. The only information needed
          for execution of join is a valid ID / IP combination of any
          existing node, which must be supplied with `NodeId'

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `NodeIP' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)


 -- PREDICATE: dht_notify/1:
     This predicate performs 'notification'. Notification is part of
     adaptation process launched by `dht_stabilize/0'. A quote from
     Chord paper that refers to this section is given below:
           n.notify(NewNodeId){
               if (predecessor is nil ||
                     NewNodeId in (predecessor, n)){
                   predecessor = NewNodeId;
               }
           }

     *Usage:* `dht_notify(NewNode)'
        - _Description:_ `dht_notify/1' is called on current node,
          once any other DHT node specified by `NewNode' regards
          current node at it's successor.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `NewNode' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)


 -- PREDICATE: dht_stabilize/0:
     `dht_stabilize'

     Perform stabilization on the successor node by asking
     successor's predecessor value. If the value returned is equal to
     current node, just stay calm, otherwise try to adopt the newly
     returned result as new successor. Most of the 'dirty' work is
     performed by `stabilize_successor/2' predicate. The
     corresponding Chord-paper quote is given below:
           n.stabilize(){
               x = successor.predecessor;
               if (x in (n, successor)){
                   successor = x;
               }
               successor.notify(n);
           }
     There is also a small simplification scheme, since before calling `dht_join/1'
     each node assumes itself as the only member of the circle, the
     very first case of `dht_stabilize/0' does nothing if successor
     is actually equal to current node.

     *Usage:*
        - _Description:_ `dht_stabilize/0' is a eternally repeated
          predicate, which aims at stabilizing first-level references
          of the finger-table, while multiple concurrent joins and
          failures can happen. Its main goal is to ask its own
          successor to report its predecessor. If the reported node
          is different from the one that is calling `dht_stabilize/0',
          there should be someone in between current node and its the
          successor. So a newly reported node should be registered as
          the successor instead of an old one. Technically, once an
          inconsistency between actual state of DHT and finger-table
          is found a newly found node is asked to perform `dht_notify/1',
          with current node as an argument.


 -- PREDICATE: dht_fix_fingers/0:
     `dht_fix_fingers'

     This predicate takes care of maintaining the finger table
     entries (except the first one) up to date. The first entry is
     taken care of by a specialized predicate `dht_stabilize/0',
     since there is much more responsibility on first entry (a direct
     successor). Rest of the same task is performed here, by `dht_fix_fingers/0'.
     In the Chord paper notation this part look like:
           n.fix_fingers(){
               i = random index > 1 into finger[];
               finger[i].node = find_successor(finger[i].start);
           }
     .

     *Usage:*
        - _Description:_ `dht_fix_fingers/0' is yet another randomly
          repeated predicate, which aims at stabilizing high-level
          references of finger-table, while multiple concurrent joins
          and failures happen. Once started, `dht_fix_fingers/0'
          picks a random (but not first) entry of finger table, and
          searches for a node responsible for the identifiers
          specified in the entry. In case, node that was found is
          different from the one currently specified, current node is
          replaced by a new one.


 -- PREDICATE: dht_id_by_node/2:
     This predicate is entirely used by remote calls. Since there is `dht_rpr_id_by_node/2'
     for current module. This is an effort to avoid
     module-re-exportation ( `dht_routing.pl' and `dht_rpr.pl').

     *Usage:* `dht_id_by_node(Node,NodeID)'
        - _Description:_ Get node identity by node number.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Node' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `NodeID' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Node' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `NodeID' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)


 -- PREDICATE: dht_find_and_consult_b/2:
     `dht_find_and_consult_b/2' is meant to perform two actions:
        * search for the node responsible for value supplied as a
          `Key';

        * perform `dht_consult_server_b/3' on a node found.
     This is the first predicate of the whole `dht_find_and_*/2'
     family of predicates. Name of each member of the family gives a
     hint on implementation. And as it is presented by the name of
     the family, they share some part of implementation - all the
     members of the family perform search for particular DHT-node,
     which is achieved by `find_server/3' predicate.

     *Usage 1:* `dht_find_and_consult_b(Key,Value)'
        - _Description:_ An invocation of this type would bind all
          free variables in `Value' to the values present in the
          local database of the node responsible for `Key'.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Key' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Value' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Key' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Value' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)

     *Usage 2:* `dht_find_and_consult_b(Key,Value)'
        - _Description:_ Invocation with two ground arguments is
          equal to checking the presence of the term specified by
          `Value' inside the DHT.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Key' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Value' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)


 -- PREDICATE: dht_consult_server_b/3:
     Basically forms the second half of `dht_find_and_consult/2'
     predicate. This predicate takes no care about search of
     corresponding server. The only thing it does - given a server
     try to locate a predicate under given `Key' there. Of course
     there two possible variants of application:

     *Usage 1:* `dht_consult_server_b(NodeId,Key,Value)'
        - _Description:_ First variant deals with real consulting,
          when the value is unknown. Therefore, after predicate is
          successfully executed, a real value, that is stored under
          `Key' is associated with third argument (`Value')

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `NodeId' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)

          `Key' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)

          `Value' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)

     *Usage 2:* `dht_consult_server_b(NodeId,Key,Value)'
        - _Description:_ Second variant is more similar to check for
          existence, All arguments are ground by the time predicate
          is called, so the only use is success/failure of predicate
          itself.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Key';

        * perform `dht_consult_server_nb/3' on a node found.
     This is the first predicate of the whole `dht_find_and_*/2'

 -- PREDICATE: dht_find_and_extract_b/2:
     `dht_find_and_extract_b/2' is meant to perform two actions:

202 Finger table and routing information
****************************************

*Author(s):* Arsen Kostenko.

   This module holds the basic operations over the finger table and
other routing information. Developed for the sake of simplicity, it
should be used only within the `dht_logic.pl' file. Probably the most
important and abstract part of the routing is the finger table. Here
is a finger table copy of the node representing identifier 0 (from
the Chord paper):

     finger_table(1, 1, finger_interval(1,2), 1).
      finger_table(2, 2, finger_interval(2,4), 3).
      finger_table(3, 4, finger_interval(4,0), 0).
   .

   This table reflects the case where there are 8 identifiers in
total in the identifier circle and three running nodes with
identifiers 0, 1, and 3. In general each entry can be represented as
`finger_table(idx, start, interval, succ)'. Here is a brief
description of each argument:
   * `idx' - Since arrays are not native for Prolog, I put the index
     as the first argument to the finger_table predicate to achieve
     indexing.

   * `start' - ID that starts the corresponding section of the table.

   * `interval' - IDs that fit into the corresponding section of
     table, represented in the form: `finger_interval(interval_start,
     interval_end).', where:
        * interval_start - ID that starts this interval.

        * interval_end - first ID of the next interval.

   * `succ' - ID of node responsible for the corresponding section of
     table, represented in `node_id(id, ip).' form, where:
        * id - ID of a node.

        * ip - IP address of a node.

==============================================

 -- PREDICATE: dht_finger_table/2:
     It serves as a read-only interface to the finger table
     information as follows: `Idx' stands for an index in an array,
     and `Node' is the number of the node which is recorded in the
     entry with that index.

     *Usage 1:* `dht_finger_table(Idx,Node)'
        - _Description:_ This case is equal to getting any (possibly
          random) entry from the finger table.

     *Usage 3:* `dht_finger_table(Idx,Node)'
        - _Description:_ Get the identifier of the node, indexed by
          `Idx'. Theoretically, there should be no more than on entry
          for each value of index.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Idx' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

        - _Description:_ Get any entry, in other words and entry that
          has any index and points to any segment in the circle.
          Common constraints on finger tables, do hold anyway:
             * result unifies with the content of finger table;

             * predicate enumerates possible results on backtracking.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Idx' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

=================================================

 -- PREDICATE: hash_size/1:
     This predicate calculates `(2**m)', where 'm' is equal to `hash_power/1'
     received from system wide configurations stored in `dht_config.pl'.

     *Usage:* `hash_size(Size)'
        - _Description:_ The only purpose of `hash_size/1' predicate
          is to get corresponding value from system wide
          configurations stored in `dht_config.pl' file and convert
          it into the number of nodes virtually available in the
          current DHT installation.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Size' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

     This predicate calculates `(2**m)-1', where 'm' is equal to `hash_power/1'
     received from system wide configurations stored in `dht_config.pl'.

     *Usage 1:* `highest_hash_number(N)'
        - _Description:_ If used with a ground argument `highest_hash_number/1'
          simply checks whether the value supplied corresponds to the
          biggest hash number possible in the DHT.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `N' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

     *Usage 2:* `highest_hash_number(N)'

          variable) the value of `N' is bound to the highest hash
          number possible in the DHT.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `N' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

          `N' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)


 -- PREDICATE: consistent_hash/2:
     This kind of computation is usually performed every time, when
     one needs to get value of hash-function.

     *Usage:* `consistent_hash(Term,DHTHash)'
        - _Description:_ Straightforward computation of hash
          (`DHTHash') on the basis of `Term' supplied.

     *Usage:* `next_on_circle(Id,Num)'
        - _Description:_ `next_on_circle/2' is a calculation
          wrapping. One can only use it with first argument ground
          and equal to integer value. What is more, that value *MUST*
          be kept within certain bounds: value of `Id' *MUST* meet
          the constraints 0<=`Id'<=`HighNum', where `HighNum' is
          retrieved via `highest_hash_number/1' predicate.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Num' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)


 -- PREDICATE: not_in_circle_oc/3:
     `not_in_circle_oc/3': the 'oc' suffix stands for "open-closed"
     interval. The predicate implements the behavior of the
     expression: `Id not_in (a,b]'. where both 'a' and 'b' are
     numbers/identifiers on the DHT-ring.

     *Usage:* `not_in_circle_oc(Id,Start,End)'
        - _Description:_ Yet another wrapper around simple
          calculations. All arguments are expected to be ground, by
          the time the predicate is called. The predicate checks
          whether the value supplied as `Id' fits into circle sector
          defined by values of `Start' and `End'. If the condition is
          not true - the whole predicate fails.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Id' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Start' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Id' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Start' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `End' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)


 -- PREDICATE: in_circle_oc/3:
     `in_circle_oc/3': the 'oc' suffix stands for "open-closed"
     interval. The predicate is based on `in_circle_oo/3' and
     considers the interval to be closed on the right. This predicate
     implements the behavior of the expression: `Id in (a,b]'

     *Usage:* `in_circle_oc(Id,Start,End)'
        - _Description:_ Check whether value of `Id' fits into sector
          defined by `Start' and `End' excluding first and including
          second. Fail if the condition does not hold.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Id' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Start' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

204 Remote predicate calling utilities
**************************************

*Author(s):* Arsen Kostenko.

   RPR stands for Remote PRedicate calling. The basic functionality
of a remote procedure (or predicate, in Prolog terms of Prolog) call
is gathered here. Thus module contains predicates for the execution
of remote calls and manipulation routines of the module-specific
database.

204.2 Documentation on exports (`dht_rpr')
==========================================

 -- PREDICATE: dht_rpr_register_node/1:

          corresponding to them. Despite there is only one usage mode
          the behavior may differ depending on the state of
          module-specific database. For instance, if the database
          already contains information about a node, whose identifier
          is equal to the one supplied in `Node', a newly supplied
          entry would be written over the old one. A new entry is

205 Underlying data-storage module
**********************************

*Author(s):* Arsen Kostenko.

   This module contains very low-level utilities of data storage
specific to a single node. Neither data sharing nor remote invocation
is performed at this level. Note that no dedicated data manipulation
is performed neither on this level. Also keep in mind that concept of
`Key' should always meet the same constraints as the second argument
of `functor/3' predicate. Important decision taken at this point is
representation of all information stored in the DHT as usual Prolog
facts. This behavior is implemented by representing relations of form
`Key' -> `Value' in form of `Key'(`Value') facts.

==============================================

 -- PREDICATE: dht_store/3:
     This predicate stores information into the local (module-local)
     database. The three arguments stand for key, value, and value of
     hash-function, when applied to the key. The third argument is
     needed for auxiliary database, which is used by reverse lookup.

     *Usage:* `dht_store(Key,KeyHash,Value)'
        - _Description:_ The value provided in `Value' is stored
          under a key given as `Key'.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Key' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

          `KeyHash' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

          `Value' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)


 -- PREDICATE: dht_extract_b/2:
     Looks up local database for fact of following type `Key'/1, that
     takes `Value' as argument. The pair is extracted from the
     database if there is at lease one match. Otherwise call is
     blocking once the fact is not found instantly.

     *Usage 1:* `dht_extract_b(Key,Value)'
        - _Description:_ Search for exact fact.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Key' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

          `Value' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

     *Usage 2:* `dht_extract_b(Key,Value)'
        - _Description:_ Search for fact matching pattern. Pattern is
          supplied as `Value'.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

 -- PREDICATE: dht_extract_nb/2:
     Looks up the local database for a fact of type `Key'/1 that
     takes `Value' as argument. If a corresponding fact is found in
     database, it is extracted from it. With respect to behavior of `dht_extract_b/2',
     this predicated has a useful difference - it does not block
     while searching.

     *Usage 1:* `dht_extract_nb(Key,Value)'
        - _Description:_ Check that combination of `Key'/`Value'
          appears in database.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Key' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

     *Usage 2:* `dht_extract_nb(Key,Value)'
        - _Description:_ Search for combination of `Key'/`Value'
          matching pattern. Pattern is supplied as `Value'.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Key' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

          `Value' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Value' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)


 -- PREDICATE: dht_consult_b/2:
     Looks up local database for combination of `Key'/`Value' of
     following type `Key'/1 that takes `Value' as argument. The
     combination of `Key'/`Value' is only looked up. If there is no
     corresponding combination of `Key'/`Value' in local database, `dht_consult_b/2'
     blocks until such fact is inserted. Nothing is done neither to
     combination of `Key'/`Value' nor to local database.

     *Usage 1:* `dht_consult_b(Key,Value)'
        - _Description:_ Search for exact combination of
          `Key'/`Value'.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Key' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

 -- PREDICATE: dht_consult_nb/2:
     Looks up local database for combination of `Key'/`Value' of
     following type `Key'/1 that takes `Value' as argument. The
     combination of `Key'/`Value' is only looked up - no
     modifications are done in any case (whether a match was found or
     not). As in case with `dht_extract_nb/2', this predicate does
     not block while searching for matching values.

     *Usage 1:* `dht_consult_nb(Key,Value)'
        - _Description:_ Search for exact combination of
          `Key'/`Value'.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Key' is an atom.   (basic_props:atm/1)

 -- PREDICATE: dht_key_hash/2:
     A general read-interface to auxiliary database, in order to
     perform reverse search: 'get set of keys by corresponding value
     of hash function'.

     *Usage 1:* `dht_key_hash(Key,KeyHash)'
        - _Description:_ The most general case (when both arguments
          are free) is searching for any key-hash pair stored in
          auxiliary database.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Key' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

          `KeyHash' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Key' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)

          `KeyHash' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

     *Usage 2:* `dht_key_hash(Key,KeyHash)'
        - _Description:_ Here `Key' is ground, which in turn leads to
          search for information on concrete predicate.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Key' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)

          `KeyHash' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Key' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)

          `KeyHash' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

     *Usage 3:* `dht_key_hash(Key,KeyHash)'
        - _Description:_ On the contrary to previous example, this
          one has only second argument `KeyHash' ground. Therefore,
          this type of call would search for keys, that where mapped
          into given value of hash-function.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Key' is a free variable.   (term_typing:var/1)

          `KeyHash' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

     *Usage 4:* `dht_key_hash(Key,KeyHash)'
        - _Description:_ Finally, calling `dht_key_hash' with both
          arguments ground is similar to straight-forward check on
          auxiliary database, or to asking a question: "Does
          auxiliary database has any information on this key, which
          is mapped into that hash value?"

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Key' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)

          `KeyHash' is an integer.   (basic_props:int/1)

207 Tiny module with miscellaneous functions
********************************************

*Author(s):* Arsen Kostenko.

   This module holds just two predicates at the moment: `write_pr/2'
and `read_pr'. In both of them the '_pr' suffix is standing for
'predicate', which in turn means that both of them are intended for
transportation of predicates from one environment to another.

===========================================

 -- PREDICATE: write_pr/2:
     `write_pr/2' is a straight-forward wrapping around the `fast_write/2'
     predicate, without any checks on arguments The sole purpose is
     to allow usage of various ways of writing to streams without
     changing entire code of DHT.

     *Usage:* `write_pr(Stream,Term)'
        - _Description:_ Write the value of the `Term' into stream
          provided by `Stream'.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Stream' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)

          `Term' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)


 -- PREDICATE: read_pr/2:
     Similarly to the previous predicate, this one serves currently
     as a wrap around the `fast_read/2' predicate, and was
     implemented with the same purpose - to allow transparent
     switching to different stream reading systems.

     *Usage 1:* `read_pr(Stream,Term)'
        - _Description:_ Read stream represented by `Stream' looking
          for presence of pattern given by `Term'. If none found, the
          predicate does not block. Result found may be non-fully
          ground.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Stream' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)

          `Term' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)

     *Usage 2:* `read_pr(Stream,Term)'
        - _Description:_ Same as previous, with only modification -
          result found may be ground as well.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Stream' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)

          `Term' is any term.   (basic_props:term/1)

        - _The following properties should hold upon exit:_

          `Stream' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)

          `Term' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)

     *Usage 3:* `read_pr(Stream,Term)'
        - _Description:_ Scan stream `Stream' for presence of
          concrete (exact) predicate given by value of `Term'. `Term'
          is fully bound.

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

          `Stream' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)

          `Term' is ground.   (basic_props:gnd/1)

210 Printing graphs using gnuplot as auxiliary tool
***************************************************

*Author(s):* David Trallero Mena.

   This library uses `gnuplot' for printing graphs.

   User-friendly predicates to generate data plots are provided, as
well as predicates to set the general options which govern the
generation of such plots. If no options is specified, global ones are
used for data plots generation.

   Several files can be generated as temporary files. A BaseName is
required for generating the temporaries files. Data files name will
be created from BaseName + number + .dat. The BaseName + ".plot" will
be the name used for `gnuplot' tool.

   A list of pairs of list of pairs of the from (X,Y) and Local
Option value is provided to the main predicate as data. In other
words DataList = [(CurveDataList,LocalOptions),
(CurveDataList1,LocalOptions1) ...]. Additionaly (function( String )
, LocalOptions) can be used for adding a curve to the plot (imagine
you want to compare your result with 'x=y').

   LocalOptions of the DataList are options that are applied to the
curve, as for example, if we print the curve with lines, or the title
in the legend, etc. GlobalOptions are referred to the plot options,
like title in x or y axis, etc.

211 Lazy evaluation
*******************

*Author(s):* Amadeo Casas (`http://www.cs.unm.edu/~amadeo',
University of New Mexico).

   This library package allows the use of lazy evaluation in a Ciao
module/program.

   Lazy Evaluation is a program evaluation technique used
particularly in functional languages. When using lazy evaluation, an
expression is not evaluated as soon as it is assigned, but rather
when the evaluator is forced to produce the value of the expression.
Although the `when' or `freeze' control primitives present in many
modern logic programming systems are more powerful than lazy
evaluation, they lack the simplicity of use and cleaner semantics of
functional lazy evaluation.

   The objective of this package is to allow evaluating the functions
lazily. Functions are the subset of relations (predicates) which have
a designated argument through which a single output is obtained for
any set of inputs (the other arguments). In logic programming systems
which have syntactic support for functions (including Ciao),
functions are typically translated to predicates whose `last'
argument is designated as a (single value) output and the rest as
inputs.

   In our proposal, a function can be declared as lazy via the
following declaration:

     :- lazy fun_eval f/N.

   This function could be represented as:

     :- lazy fun_eval f(~_,_,_,_).

   where ~ indicates the argument through which the single output
will be obtained. Another possible representation may be:

     :- lazy fun_return f(~_,_,_,_).

In order to achieve the intended behavior, the execution of each
function declared as lazy is suspended until the return value of the
function is needed.

   A simple example of the use of lazy evaluation would be the
definition of a function which returns the (potentially) infinite
list of integers starting with a given one:

     :- lazy fun_eval nums_from/1.
     nums_from(X) := [X | nums_from(X+1)].

While lazy functions certainly increase the overhead in the
execution, they also allow the user to develop in an easy way
predicates which can handle infinite terms, and this is the main
advantage of the proposed functionality.

   Lazy evaluation can be also a better option than eager evaluation
when a function in a different module is used and it returns a big
amount of data. As an example, we have the following module `module1':

     :- module(module1, [test/1], [fsyntax, lazy, hiord]).

     :- use_module(library(lazy(lazy_lib)), [nums_from/2, takeWhile/3]).
     :- use_module(module2, [squares/2]).
     :- use_module(library(arithpreds)).

     :- fun_eval test/0.
     test := ~takeWhile((''(X) :- X < 10000), ~squares(~nums_from(1))).

and another module `module2':

     :- module(module1, [test/1], [fsyntax, lazy, hiord]).

     :- use_module(library(lazy(lazy_lib)), [nums_from/2, takeWhile/3]).
     :- use_module(module2, [squares/2]).
     :- use_module(library(arithpreds)).

     :- fun_eval test/0.
     test := ~takeWhile((''(X) :- X < 10000), ~squares(~nums_from(1))).

Function `test/0' in module `m1' needs to execute function
`squares/1', in module `m2', which will return a very long list (in
the case of this example this list will be infinite, but the
conclusions also apply with finite but long lists). If `squares/1'
were executed eagerly then the entire list would be returned, to
immediately execute the `take/2' function with the entire list, but
creating this intermediate result is wasteful in terms of memory
requirements. In order to solve this problem, the `squares/1'
function could be moved to module `m1' and merged with `take/2' (or,
also, they could exchange a size parameter). But rearranging the
program is not always possible and may perhaps complicate other
aspects of the overall program design.

   If instead the `squares/1' function is evaluated lazily, it is
possible to keep the definitions unchanged and in different modules
and there will be a smaller memory penalty for storing the
intermediate result. As more values are needed by the `take/2'
function, more values in the list returned by `squares/1' are built
(in this example, only 10 values). These values that have been
consumed and passed over will be recovered by the garbage collector
and the corresponding memory freed. The query:

     ?- test(X).

will compute `X' = [1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100].

   A library of useful functions has been added to this package to
allow the programmer to develop lazy functions easily and with a
well-defined syntax. This library is called *lazy_lib.pl* and it
provides the following functions:

   * nums_from(+X,-List): `List' is unified with an infinite list of
     successive numbers starting in `X'.

   * nums_from_inc(+X,+Y,-List): `List' is unified with an infinite
     list of successive numbers starting in `X' with an increment of
     `Y'.

   * repeat(+X,-List): `List' is unified with an infinite list of the
     term `Y'.

   * cycle(+X,-List): `List' is unified with an infinite list of the
     term `Y' repeated infinite times.

   * take(+X,+ListA,-ListR): `ListR' is unified with the first `X'
     elements of the infinite list `ListA'.

   * takeWhile(+P,+ListA,-ListR): `ListR' is unified with the first
     elements of the infinite list `ListA' while the condition `P' is
     true.

   * drop(+X,+ListA,-ListR): `ListR' is unified with the infinite
     list `ListA' dropping the first `X' elements.

   * dropWhile(+P,+ListA,-ListR): `ListR' is unified with the
     infinite list `ListA' dropping the first elements while the
     condition `P' is true.

   * splitAt(+X,+ListA,-Res): `Res' is unified with a tuple of lists
     where the first list is composed by the first `X' elements of
     the list `ListA' and the second list is composed by the rest of
     the elements of `ListA'.

   * span(+P,+ListA,-Res): `Res' is unified with a tuple of lists
     where the first list is composed by the elements of `ListA'
     which verify the condition `P' and the second list is composed
     by the rest of the elements of the initial list.

211.2 Other information (`lazy_doc')
====================================

The translation of the code in order to execute it lazily is
explained below.

   A sentence translation is provided to handle the `lazy'
directives. The translation of a lazy function into a predicate is
done in two steps. First, the function is converted into a predicate
(using the fsyntax package). Then, the resulting predicate is
transformed to suspend its execution until the value of the last
variable (i.e., the output variable) is needed. This suspension is
achieved by the use of the `freeze/1' control primitive that many
modern logic programming systems implement quite efficiently (`block'
or `when' declarations can obviously also be used, but we explain the
transformation in terms of `freeze' because it is more widespread).
The translation will rename the original predicate to an internal
name and add a bridge predicate with the original name which invokes
the internal predicate through a call to `freeze/1'. This will delay
the execution of the internal predicate until its result is required,
which will be detected as a binding (i.e., demand) of its output
variable.

   We show now an example of the use of lazy evaluation, and how a
lazy function is translated by this package. The following code
returns an (infinite) list of fibonacci numbers:

     :- lazy fun_eval fiblist/0.
     fiblist := [0, 1 | ~zipWith(add, FibL, ~tail(FibL))]
             :- FibL = fiblist.

which is translated into:

     fiblist(X) :-
               freeze(X, 'fiblist_$$lazy$$'(X)).

     'fiblist_$$lazy$$'([0, 1 | Rest]) :-
               fiblist(FibL),
               tail(FibL, T),
               zipWith(add, FibL, T, Rest).

In the `fiblist' function defined, any element in the resulting
infinite list of fibonacci numbers can be referenced, as for example,
`nth(X, ~fiblist, Value).'. The other functions used in the
definition are `tail/2' and `zipWith/3'. These two functions can be
found in the *lazy_lib.pl* runtime file.

212 Programming MYCIN rules
***************************

*Author(s):* Angel Fernandez Pineda.

   MYCIN databases are declared as Prolog modules containing mycin
rules. Those rules are given a _certainty factor_ (_CF_) which
denotates an expert's credibility on that rule:
   * A value of -1 stands for _surely not_.

   * A value of 1 stands for _certainly_.

   * A value of 0 stands for _I don't know_.


   Intermediate values are allowed.

   Mycin rules work on a different way as Prolog clauses: a rule will
never fail (in the Prolog sense), it will return a certainty value
instead. As a consequence *all* mycin rules will be explored during
inference, so the order in which rules are written is not
significant. For this reason, the usage of the Prolog _cut_ (!) is
discouraged.

212.2 Documentation on new declarations (`mycin_doc')
=====================================================

 -- DECLARATION: export/1:
     This directive allows a given mycin predicate to be called from
     Prolog programs. The way in which mycin rules are called departs
     from Prolog ones. For instance, the followin mycin predicate:
          :- export p/1.

     must be called from Prolog Programs as: `mycin(p(X),CF)', where
     CF will be binded to the resulting certainty factor. Obviously,
     the variables on _P/1_ may be instantiated as you wish. Since
     the Prolog predicate _mycin/2_ may be imported from several
     mycin databases, it is recommended to fully qualify those
     predicate goals. For example : `mydatabase:mycin(p(X),CF)'.

     *Usage:* :- `export(Spec)'.
        - _Description:_ `Spec' will be a callable mycin predicate.

=======================================================

   * Not fully implemented.

213 The Ciao Profiler
*********************

*Author(s):* Edison Mera.

   The Ciao profiler provides a high-level, flexible way to mark a
predicate (or a literal) for profiling. This is done by using
declarations to indicate if a program element must be instrumented or
not.

   By default, if the user does not specify anything, no predicate
inside the module will be instrumented as cost center for profiling.
The use of at least one declaration saying that a specific predicate
must be instrumented overrides this behavior.

   The declaration is as follows:

     	:- cost_center pred1/Arity1, ... predN/ArityN.

   where `pred1/Arity1', ..., `predN/ArityN' are the predicates to be
instrumented as cost centers. They can be separated by commas or the
can be in a list.

   By default the engine hooks of all defined cost center are active.
The declaration:

           (predN/ArityN,nohooks)

   will deactivate them.

   Another useful declaration makes possible to indicate that a given
predicate is not going to be instrumented as cost center:

     	:- no_cost_center pred1/Arity1, ... predN/ArityN.

   where `pred1/Arity1', ..., `predN/ArityN' are the predicates that
will not be instrumented as cost centers. There are two options (as
in the previous case): write one assertion for each predicate or
declare more than one predicate (separated by commas or in a list) in
only one assertion.

   The following assertions define the behavior of all the predicates
of the module:

     	:- all_cost_center.

     	:- all_no_cost_center.

   They specify respectively that all the predicates in the module
will be instrumented as cost centers and that no predicate in the
module will be instrumented as cost center. In the first assertion
the engine hooks of all defined cost centers are active. The
declaration `:- all_cost_center(nohooks).' will deactivate them.

   Cost centers can be also defined at literal level replacing the
literal by the declaration:

     	:- cost_center(name_cc, literal)

   where `literal' is the program literal and `name_cc' is the name
of its associated cost center. At predicate level the name of both
cost center and predicate are equal.

214 ProVRML - a Prolog interface for VRML
*****************************************

*Author(s):* Go"ran Smedba"ck, Manuel Carro (some changes), The CLIP
Group.

   `ProVRML' is Prolog library to handle VRML code. The library
consists of modules to handle the tokenising, that is breaking the
VRML code into smaller parts that can be analysed further. The
further analysis will be the parsing. This is a complex part of the
library and consists of several modules to handle errors and value
check. When the parsing is done we have the Prolog terms of the VRML
code. The terms are quite similar to the origin VRML code and can
easily be read if you recognise that syntax.

   This Prolog terms of the VRML code is then possible to use for
analysis, reconstruction, reverse enginering, building blocks for
automatic generation of VRML code. There are several possibilities
and these are only some of them.

   When you are done with the Prolog terms for the code, you would
probably want to reverse the action and return to VRML code. This is
done with the code generation modules. These are built up in more or
less the same manner as the parser modules.

          will be done in other module but initiated here. The values
          will be, if correct, collected via the DCG with the out/3
          predicate for later output.

          All the predicates have the same meaning as the
          corresponding predicates in the input module
          field_value.pl. For more information about the different
          please see that module.

        - _Description:_ The predicate will check the rule name's
          possible followers, that is the entrance in the grammar, to

          ahead to see if we have the proper key name ahead. Then we
          check the possible alternatives for the rule name from the
          list and type we receive from the call to possible. As we
          can see there are different look ahead predicates depending
          if we have a token or a word, looking on the structure
          name(token name) or if we should read the first word beyond

231 Pattern (regular expression) matching
*****************************************

*Author(s):* The CLIP Group.

   This library provides facilities for matching strings and terms
against _patterns_. There are some prolog flags
   * There is a prolog flag to case insensitive match. Its name is
     case_insensitive. If its value is on, matching is case
     insenseitive, but if its value is off matching isn't case
     insensitive. By default, its value is off.

   * There is a syntax facility to use matching more or less like a
     unification. You can type, " =~ "regexp" " as an argument of a
     predicate. Thus, that argument must match with regexp. For
     example:

                    pred ( =~ "ab*c", B) :- ...

     is equivalent to

                    pred (X,B) :- match_posix("ab*c",X,R), ...

     So, there are two prolog flags about this. One of this prolog
     flags is "format". Its values are shell, posix, list and pred,
     and sustitute in the example match_posix by match_shell,
     match_posix, match_struct and macth_pred respectivly. By default
     its value is posix. The other prolog flag is exact. Its values
     are on and off. If its value is off sustitute in the example R
     by []. If its value is on, R is a variable. By default, its
     value is on.

233 Automatic tester
********************

*Author(s):* David Trallero Mena.

   This module have been created to automate the test that a
predicate should pass hopefully. With that intention we have to
provide a set of test and its correct answers. The predicate `run_tester/10'
will execute every test and compare it with its answer, generating
two traces, one with detailed information, and another with the
summary of executions of the tests.

     *Usage:*
     `run_tester(LogFile,ResultFile,Begin,Test,TestList,Check,CheckList,End,GoodExamples,Slider)'
        - _Description:_ run_tester is a predicate for automatizate
          testers. It get 2 file names as entry (`LogFile' and
          `ResultFile') for saving the trace and the short result
          scheme respectevely. `Being' and `End' are called at the
          beginning and at the end of the test. `Test' is called
          which each element of `TestList' and after, `Check' is
          called with the corresponding element in `CheckList' for
          checking the results of `Test' predicate. `GoodExample' is
          ground(int) at the exit and tells the number of examples
          that passed the test correctly. `Slider' can take the
          values slider(no) or slider(Title) and slider will be shown
          everytime a new test is called

        - _The following properties should hold at call time:_

================================================

 -- PREDICATE: performance/3:
     _Meta-predicate_ with arguments: `performance(goal,?,?)'.

     *Usage:* `performance(P,M,Times)'
        - _Description:_ performance accepts a goal, `P', as a first
          argument. The aim of this predicate is to call `P' several
          times and meassure some feature (in this version, only
          time, that is reason because no extra parameter has been
          added). `M' defines how many times `P' should be called.
          Usually, calling the predicate in some succesion
          (10,100,1000) and dividing by the number of times it is
          executed we can obtain the "execution time" of the
          predicate (if we are measuring time).

          The result of executions are returned in the list `Times'

          The diferent modes are:
             * graph( Start , End , Increment ). It defines
               arithmetic succesion starting in Start and ending in
               End, by increment of Increment. So `P' is called Start
               times on the first time, Start+Increment on the
               second, etc.

             * graph The same as graph/3 but with default options

             * graph_exp( Start , End , Exp ). It defines geometric
               succesion. Start is multiplied by Exp till it gets
               End. So `P' is called Start times on the first time,
               Start*Exp on the second, etc.

             * graph_exp The same as graph_exp/3 but with default
               options

          argument, is called with the first member of each pair of
          the `BenchList' list `NumTimes'. The entry list have pairs
          because the second member of the pair express the meaning
          of the first one in the X-Axis. For example, if we are
          doing a benchmark of qsort function, the first member will
          be a list for being ordered and the second one will be the
          length of the unordered list. The output is a list of (X,Y)
          points where Y means the time needed for its entry of
          "cost" X. `OutList' can be used as TimeList in predicate

          desired featured for be measured) is expected to be the
          second argument, that is because it is a variable. The
          entry list, `BenchList' have pairs because the second
          member of the pair express the cost of the first (in
          X-Axis). For example, if we are doing a benchmark of qsort
          function, the first member will be a list for being ordered
          and the second one will represent the lenght of the
          unordered list. The output is a list of (X,Y) points where

235 XDR handle library
**********************

*Author(s):* Jose' Manuel Go'mez Pe'rez.

   This library offers facilities to enable users to setup
preferences on the values an eventual XML document may take. XML
documents are specified by XDR documents (eXternal Data
Representation standard), in a way conceptually similar to that of
objects and classes in object oriented programming. These facilities
allow to take as input an XDR Schema defining the class of documents
of interest, and establish a dialogue with the user via an HTML form
that allows the user to setup preferences to select sub-classes of
documents (those which satisfy the preferences). The preferences are
the output of the process and may be in the form of XPath
expressions, for example, as can be seen in the example attached in
the "examples" directory.

   This package provides a language suitable for querying XML
documents from a Prolog program. Constraint programming expresions
can be included in order to prune search as soon as possible, i.e.
upon constraint unsatisfability, improving efficiency. Also,
facilities are offered to improve search speed by transforming XML
documents into Prolog programs, hence reducing search to just running
the program and taking advantage of Prolog's indexing capabilities.

   Queries in an XML document have a recursive tree structructure
that permits to detail the search on the XML element sought, its
attributes, and its children. As a suffix, a constraint programming
expression can be added. Queries return value for the free variables
included (in case of success), and checks whether the XML document
structure matches that depicted by the query itself.

   The operators introduced are described below:

   * _@_ Delimits a subquery on an elment's attribute, such as
     `product@val(product_name, "car")', the first argument being the
     attribute name and the second its value. Any of them can be free
     variables, being possible to write queries like
     `product@val(Name, "car")', intended to find the 'Name' of
     attributes of element product whose value is the string "car".

   * _::_ The right-hand side of the subexpression delimited by this
     operator is a query on the children elements of the element
     described on its left-hand side.

   * _with_ Declares the constraints the items sought must satisfy.


   Some examples of this query language (more can be found in the
examples directory):

   * Example A:


     product@val(product_name,"car")::(quantity(X),
                                       'time-left'(Y),
                                       negotiation::preference::price(Z))
            with X * Z .>. Y

   * Example B:


     nitf::head::docdata::'doc-id'@val('id-string',"020918050")::(Y),
                          body::'body.head'::abstract::p(X)

************************************************

*Author(s):* Manuel Carro, Daniel Cabeza, Manuel Hermenegildo.

   This describes the installation procedure for the Ciao system,
including libraries and manuals, from a _source_ distribution. This
applies primarily to Unix-type systems (Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris,
SunOS, etc.). However, the sources can also be compiled if so desired
on Windows systems - see *note Installation and compilation under
Windows:: for details.

   If you find any problems during installation, please refer to

File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Un*x installation summary,  Next: Un*x full installation instructions,  Prev: Installing Ciao from the source distribution,  Up: Installing Ciao from the source distribution

237.1 Un*x installation summary
===============================

*Note*: It is recommended that you read the full installation
instructions (specially if the installation will be shared by
different architectures). However, in many cases it suffices to
follow this summary:

  1. Uncompress and unpackage (using `gunzip' and `tar -xpf') the
     distribution. This will put everything in a new directory whose
     name reflects the Ciao version.

  2. Type `./ciaosetup configure'. This will autodetect and configure
     the system for your specific platform. If you need more control
     about what configure does, just add the option `--help' to see
     more arguments.

     The option `--menu' show a menu with configurable options. You
     must follow the instructions that appears on it.

     Note that the GNU implementation of the make Un*x command is
     used internally in some specific parts. It is available in many
     systems (including all Linux systems and Mac OS X) simply as `make'.
     If this or next steps stop right away with `make' error messages
     it is probably an older version and you need to install `gmake'.

  3. Type `./ciaosetup build'. This will build executables and
     compile libraries.

  4. Type `./ciaosetup install'. This will install everything in the
     specified directories.

  5. The system will do the right modifications in your startup
     scripts. This will make the documentation accessible, set the
     correct mode when opening Ciao source files in `emacs', etc. The
     modified files are tagged with the names \'DOTBASHRC\',
     \'DOTCSHRC\' and \'DOTEMACS\', which are the startup files for
     bash, csh and emacs respectively.

     The following modifications are done automatically in your
     startup scripts, and you don't need to do it manually. This will
     make the documentation accessible, set the correct mode when
     opening Ciao source files in `emacs', etc. Note that
     `<v>libroot</v>' must be replaced with the appropriate value: 

        * For users a _csh-compatible shell_ ( `csh', `tcsh', ...),
          add to `~/.cshrc':

                       if ( -e <v>libroot</v>/ciao/DOTcshrc ) then
                          source <v>libroot</v>/ciao/DOTcshrc
                       endif

          *Note*: while this is recognized by the terminal shell, and
          therefore by the text-mode Emacs which comes with Mac OS X,
          the Aqua native Emacs 21 does not recognize that
          initialization. It is thus necessary, at this moment, to
          set manually the Ciao shell (ciaosh) and Ciao library
          location by hand. This can be done from the Ciao menu
          within Emacs after a Ciao file has been loaded. We believe
          that the reason is that Mac OS X does not actually consult
          the per-user initialization files on startup. It should
          also be possible to put the right initializations in the
          .emacs file using the `setenv' function of Emacs-lisp, as in

               (setenv "CIAOLIB" "<v>libroot</v>/ciao")

          The same can be done for the rest of the variables
          initialized in `<v>libroot</v>/ciao/DOTcshrc'

        * For users of an _sh-compatible shell_ ( `sh', `bash', ...),
          the installer will add to `~/.bashrc' the next lines:

                       if [ -f <v>libroot</v>/ciao/DOTprofile ]; then
                          . <v>libroot</v>/ciao/DOTprofile
                       fi

          This will set up things so that the Ciao executables are
          found and you can access the Ciao system manuals using the `info'
          command. Note that, depending on your shell, _you may have
          to log out and back in_ for the changes to take effect.

        * Also, if you use `emacs' (highly recommended) the install
          will add the next line to your `~/.emacs' file:

                       (load-file "<v>libroot</v>/ciao/ciao-mode-init.el")
                       (if (file-exists-p "<v>libroot</v>/ciao/ciao-mode-init.el")
                         (load-file "<v>libroot</v>/ciao/ciao-mode-init.el")
                       )


     If you are installing Ciao globally in a multi-user machine,
     make sure that you instruct all users to do the same. If you are
     the system administrator, the previous steps can be done once
     and for all, and globally for all users by including the lines
     above in the central startup scripts (e.g., in Linux `/etc/bashrc', `/etc/csh.login', `/etc/csh.cshrc', `/etc/skel', `/usr/share/emacs/.../lisp/site-init.pl',
     etc.).

  6. Finally, if the (freely available) `emacs' editor/environment is
     not installed in your system, we _highly recommend_ that you
     also install it at this point (see *note Un*x full installation
     instructions:: for instructions). While it is easy to use Ciao
     with any editor of your choice, the Ciao distribution includes a
     very powerful _application development environment_ which is
     based on `emacs' and which enables, e.g., source-level
     debugging, syntax coloring, context-sensitive on-line help, etc.

  7. You may want now want to check your installation (see *note
     Checking for correct installation on Un*x::) and read the
     documentation, which is stored in `DOCDIR' (copied from
     `CIAOSRC/doc/reference') and can be easily accessed as explained
     in that same section. There are special "getting started"
     sections at the beginning of the manual.

  8. If you have any problems you may want to check the rest of the
     instructions. The system can be _uninstalled_ by typing
     `./ciaosetup uninstall'.  



File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Un*x full installation instructions,  Next: Checking for correct installation on Un*x,  Prev: Un*x installation summary,  Up: Installing Ciao from the source distribution

237.2 Un*x full installation instructions
=========================================

  1. *Uncompress and unpackage:* (using `gunzip' and `tar -xpf') the
     distribution in a suitable directory. This will create a new
     directory called `ciao-X.Y', where `X.Y' is the version number
     of the distribution. The `-p' option in the `tar' command
     ensures that the relative dates of the files in the package are
     preserved, which is needed for correct operation of the
     Makefiles.

  2. *Select installation options:* Run the `./ciaosetup configure'
     command and answer the questions that appears in the menu. The
     meaning of some important options in the menu is as follows:

          %

        * `CIAOSRC': directory where the sources are % stored.  

        * `BINROOT': directory where the Ciao executables will go.
          For example, if `BINROOT=/usr/local/bin', then the Ciao compiler
          ( `ciaoc') will be stored at `/usr/local/bin/ciaoc'.
          Actually, it will be a link to `ciaoc-'_VersionNumber_.
          This applies also to other executables below and is done so
          that several versions of Ciao can coexist on the same
          machine. Note that the _version installed latest_ will be
          the one started by default when typing `ciao', `ciaoc', etc.  

        * `LIBROOT': directory where the run-time libraries will be
          installed.  The Ciao installation procedure will create a
          new subdirectory `ciao' below `LIBROOT' and a subdirectory
          below this one for each Ciao version installed. For
          example, if `LIBROOT=/usr/local/lib' and you have Ciao
          version `x.y', then the libraries will be installed under
          `/usr/local/lib/ciao/ciao-x.y'. This allows you to install site-specific
          programs under `/usr/local/lib/ciao' and they will not be
          overwritten if a new version of Ciao is installed. It also
          again allows having several Ciao versions installed
          simultaneously.

        * `DOCDIR': directory where the manuals will be installed. It
          is often convenient if this directory is accessible via WWW
          (`DOCDIR=/home/httpd/html/ciao', or something like that).


     For network-based installations, it is of _utmost importance_
     that the configured paths be reachable in all the networked
     machines. Different machines with different architectures can
     share the same physical source directory during installation,
     since compilations for different architectures take place in
     dedicated subdirectories. Also, different machines/architectures
     can share the same `LIBROOT' directory (`LIBROOT' is configured
     in the menu). This saves space since the
     architecture-independent libraries will be shared. See *note
     Multiarchitecture support:: below.

  3. *Compile Ciao:* At the ciao top level directory type
     `./ciaosetup build'.

     This will:

        * Build an engine in `$(CIAOSRC)/bin/$(CIAOARCH)', where
          `$(CIAOARCH)' depends on the architecture. The engine is
          the actual interpreter of the low level code into which
          Ciao programs are compiled.

        * Build a new Ciao standalone compiler ( `ciaoc'), with the
          default paths set for your local configuration
          (nonetheless, these can be overridden by environment
          variables, as described below).

        * Precompile all the libraries under `$(CIAOSRC)/lib' and
          `$(CIAOSRC)/library' using this compiler.

        * Compile a toplevel Ciao shell and a shell for Ciao scripts, under
          the `$(CIAOSRC)/shell' directory.

        * Compile some small, auxiliary applications (contained in the `etc'
          directory, and documented in the part of the manual on
          'Miscellaneous Standalone Utilities').


     This step can be repeated successively for several architectures
     in the same source directory. Only the engine and some small
     parts of the libraries (those written in C) differ from one
     architecture to the other. Standard Ciao code compiles into bytecode
     object files (`.po') and/or executables which are portable among
     machines of different architecture, provided there is an
     executable engine accessible in every such machine. See more
     details below under *note Multiarchitecture support::.

  4. *Check compilation:* If the above steps have been satisfactorily
     finished, the compiler has compiled itself and all the
     distribution modules, and very probably everything is fine.

  5. *Install Ciao:* To install Ciao in the directories selected in
     the configuration script during step 2 above, type `./ciaosetup
     install'. This will:

        * Install the executables of the Ciao program development
          tools (i.e., the general driver/top-level `ciao', the
          standalone compiler `ciaoc', the script interpreter `ciao-shell',
          miscellaneous utilities, etc.) in `BINROOT' (see below). In
          order to use these tools, the `PATH' environment variable
          of users needs to contain the path `BINROOT'.

        * Install the Ciao libraries under `LIBROOT/ciao' (these will
          be automatically found).

        * Install under `DOCDIR' the Ciao manuals in several formats
          (such as GNU `info', `html', `postscript', etc.), depending
          on the distribution. In order for these manuals to be found
          when typing `M-x info' within `emacs', or by the standalone `info'
          and `man' commands, the `MANPATH' and `INFOPATH' environment
          variables of users both need to contain the path `DOCDIR'.

        * Install under `LIBROOT/ciao' the Ciao GNU `emacs' interface
          ( `ciao.el', which provides an interactive interface to the
          Ciao program development tools, as well as some other
          auxiliary files) and a file `ciao-mode-init' containing the `emacs'
          initialization commands which are needed in order to use
          the Ciao `emacs' interface.


  6. *Set up user environments:* In order to automate the process of
     setting the variables above, the installation process leaves the
     files `LIBROOT/ciao/DOTcshrc' (for `csh'-like shells),
     `LIBROOT/ciao/DOTprofile' (for `sh'-like shells), and
     `LIBROOT/ciao/ciao-mode-init' (for emacs) with appropriate
     definitions which will take care of all needed environment
     variable definitions and emacs mode setup. If you has indicated
     in the menu that the startup files must be modified, then the
     install process will do it for you, otherwise you can modify by
     hand these files making the following modifications in your
     startup scripts, so that these files are used (`<v>libroot</v>'
     must be replaced with the appropriate value):

        * For users a _csh-compatible shell_ ( `csh', `tcsh', ...),
          add to `~/.cshrc':

                       if ( -e <v>libroot</v>/ciao/DOTcshrc ) then
                          source <v>libroot</v>/ciao/DOTcshrc
                       endif

          *Note*: while this is recognized by the terminal shell, and
          therefore by the text-mode Emacs which comes with Mac OS X,
          the Aqua native Emacs 21 does not recognize that
          initialization. It is thus necessary, at this moment, to
          set manually the Ciao shell (ciaosh) and Ciao library
          location by hand. This can be done from the Ciao menu
          within Emacs after a Ciao file has been loaded. We believe
          that the reason is that Mac OS X does not actually consult
          the per-user initialization files on startup. It should
          also be possible to put the right initializations in the
          .emacs file using the `setenv' function of Emacs-lisp, as in

               (setenv "CIAOLIB" "<v>libroot</v>/ciao")

          The same can be done for the rest of the variables
          initialized in `<v>libroot</v>/ciao/DOTcshrc'

        * For users of an _sh-compatible shell_ ( `sh', `bash', ...),
          the installer will add to `~/.bashrc' the next lines:

                       if [ -f <v>libroot</v>/ciao/DOTprofile ]; then
                          . <v>libroot</v>/ciao/DOTprofile
                       fi

          This will set up things so that the Ciao executables are
          found and you can access the Ciao system manuals using the `info'
          command. Note that, depending on your shell, _you may have
          to log out and back in_ for the changes to take effect.

        * Also, if you use `emacs' (highly recommended) the install
          will add the next line to your `~/.emacs' file:

                       (load-file "<v>libroot</v>/ciao/ciao-mode-init.el")
                       (if (file-exists-p "<v>libroot</v>/ciao/ciao-mode-init.el")
                         (load-file "<v>libroot</v>/ciao/ciao-mode-init.el")
                       )


     If you are installing Ciao globally in a multi-user machine,
     make sure that you instruct all users to do the same. If you are
     the system administrator, the previous steps can be done once
     and for all, and globally for all users by including the lines
     above in the central startup scripts (e.g., in Linux `/etc/bashrc', `/etc/csh.login', `/etc/csh.cshrc', `/etc/skel', `/usr/share/emacs/.../lisp/site-init.pl',
     etc.).

  7. *Download and install Emacs (highly recommended):* If the
     (freely available) `emacs' editor is not installed in your
     system, its installation is _highly recommended_ (if you are
     installing in a multi-user machine, you may want to do it in a
     general area so that it is available for other users, even if
     you do not use it yourself). While it is easy to use Ciao with
     any editor of your choice, the Ciao distribution includes a very
     powerful _application development environment_ which is based on `emacs'
     and which enables, e.g., source-level debugging, syntax
     coloring, context-sensitive on-line help, etc.

     The emacs editor (in all its versions: Un*x, Windows, etc.) can
     be downloaded from, for example, `http://www.emacs.org/', and
     also from the many GNU mirror sites worldwide (See
     `http://www.gnu.org/' for a list), in the `gnu/emacs' and
     `gnu/windows/emacs' directories. You can find answers to
     frequently asked questions (FAQ) about `emacs' in general at
     `http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-faq.text' and about the
     Windows version at
     `http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html'
     (despite the `ntemacs' name it runs fine also as is on Win9X and
     Win2000 machines).

  8. *Check installation / read documentation:* You may now want to
     check your installation (see *note Checking for correct
     installation on Un*x::) and read the documentation, which is
     stored in `DOCDIR' (copied from `CIAOSRC/doc/reference') and can
     be easily accessed as explained that same section. There are
     special "getting started" sections at the beginning of the
     manual.


   If you have any problems you may want to check *note
Troubleshooting (nasty messages and nifty workarounds)::.

   The system can be _uninstalled_ by typing `./ciaosetup uninstall'
in the top directory. Configuration should have not changed since
installation, so that the same directories are cleaned (i.e. the
variables in `SETTINGS' should have the same value as when the
install was performed).  


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Checking for correct installation on Un*x,  Next: Cleaning up the source directory,  Prev: Un*x full installation instructions,  Up: Installing Ciao from the source distribution

237.3 Checking for correct installation on Un*x
===============================================

If everything has gone well, several applications and tools should be
available to a normal user. Try the following while logged in as a
_normal user_ (important in order to check that permissions are set
up correctly):

   * Typing `ciao' (or `ciaosh') should start the typical
     Prolog-style top-level shell.

   * In the top-level shell, Ciao library modules should load
     correctly. Type for example `use_module(library(dec10_io))' -you
     should get back a prompt with no errors reported.

   * To exit the top level shell, type `halt.' as usual, or <^D>.

   * Typing `ciaoc' should produce the help message from the Ciao standalone
     compiler.

   * Typing `ciao-shell' should produce a message saying that no code
     was found. This is a Ciao application which can be used to write scripts
     written in Ciao, i.e., files which do not need any explicit
     compilation to be run.


Also, the following documentation-related actions should work:

   * If the `info' program is installed, typing `info' should produce
     a list of manuals which _should include Ciao manual(s) in a
     separate area_ (you may need to log out and back in so that your
     shell variables are reinitialized for this to work).

   * Opening with a WWW browser (e.g., `netscape') the directory or
     `URL' corresponding to the `DOCDIR' setting should show a series
     of Ciao-related manuals. Note that _style sheets_ should be
     activated for correct formatting of the manual.

   * Typing `man ciao' should produce a man page with some very basic
     general information on Ciao (and pointing to the on-line
     manuals).

   * The `DOCDIR' directory should contain the manual also in the
     other formats such as `postscript' or `pdf' which specially
     useful for printing. See *note Printing manuals (Un*x):: for
     instructions.


   Finally, if `emacs' is installed, after starting it (typing
`emacs') the following should work:

   * Typing <^H> <i> (or in the menus `Help->Manuals->Browse Manuals
     with Info') should open a list of manuals in info format in
     which the Ciao manual(s) should appear.

   * When opening a Ciao file, i.e., a file with `.pl' or `.pls'
     ending, using <^X><^F>`filename' (or using the menus) the code
     should appear highlighted according to syntax (e.g., comments in
     red), and `Ciao/Prolog' menus should appear in the menu bar on
     top of the `emacs' window.

   * Loading the file using the `Ciao/Prolog' menu (or typing <^C>
     <l>) should start in another emacs buffer the Ciao toplevel
     shell and load the file. You should now be able to switch the
     the toplevel shell and make queries from within `emacs'.


*Note*: when using `emacs' it is _very convenient_ to swap the
locations of the (normally not very useful) <Caps Lock> key and the
(very useful in `emacs') <Ctrl> key on the keyboard. How to do this
is explained in the `emacs' frequently asked questions FAQs (see the `emacs'
download instructions for their location).

237.4 Cleaning up the source directory
======================================

After installation, the source directory can be cleaned up in several
ways:

   * `./ciaosetup uninstall' removes the installation but does not
     touch the source directories.

   * `./ciaosetup totalclean' leaves the distribution is its original
     form, throwing away any intermediate files (as well as any
     unneeded files left behind by the Ciao developers), while still
     allowing recompilation.



File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Multiarchitecture support,  Next: Installation and compilation under Windows,  Prev: Cleaning up the source directory,  Up: Installing Ciao from the source distribution

237.5 Multiarchitecture support
===============================

As mentioned before, Ciao applications (including the compiler and
the top level) can run on several machines with different
architectures without any need for recompiling, provided there is one
Ciao engine (compiled for the corresponding architecture) accessible
in each machine. Also, the Ciao libraries (installed in `LIBROOT',
which contain also the engines) and the actual binaries (installed in
`BINROOT') can themselves be shared on several machines with
different architectures, saving disk space.

   For example, assume that the compiler is installed as:

   `/usr/local/share/bin/ciaoc'

   and the libraries are installed under

   `/usr/local/share/lib'

   Assume also that the `/usr/local/share' directory is mounted on,
say, a number of Linux and a number of Solaris boxes. In order for
`ciaoc' to run correctly on both types of machines, the following is
needed:

  1. Make sure you that have done `./ciaosetup install' on one
     machine of each architecture (once for Linux and once for
     Solaris in our example). This recompiles and installs a new
     engine and any architecture-dependent parts of the libraries for
     each architecture. The engines will have names such as
     `ciaoengine.LINUXi86', `ciaoengine.SolarisSparc', and so on.

  2. In multi-architecture environments it is even more important to
     make sure that users make the modifications to their startup
     scripts using `<v>libroot</v>/ciao/DOTcshrc' etc. The selection
     of the engine (and architecture-dependent parts of libraries) is
     done in these scripts by setting the environment variable
     `CIAOARCH', using the `ciao_get_arch' command, which is
     installed automatically when installing Ciao. This will set
     `CIAOARCH' to, say, `LINUXi86', `SolarisSparc', respectively,
     and `CIAOENGINE' will be set to `ciaoengine.'_CIAOARCH_.

     However, note that this is not strictly necessary if running on
     only one architecture: if `CIAOARCH' is not set (i.e.,
     undefined), the Ciao executables will look simply for
     `ciaoengine', which is always a link to the latest engine
     installed in the libraries. But including the initialization
     files provided has the advantage of setting also paths for the
     manuals, etc.



File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Installation and compilation under Windows,  Next: Porting to currently unsupported operating systems,  Prev: Multiarchitecture support,  Up: Installing Ciao from the source distribution

237.6 Installation and compilation under Windows
================================================

There are two possibilities in order to install Ciao on Windows
machines:

   * Installing from the Windows _precompiled_ distribution. This is
     the easiest since it requires no compilation and is highly
     recommended. This is described in *note Installing Ciao from a
     Win32 binary distribution::.

   * Installing the standard Ciao (Un*x) system source distribution
     and compiling it under Windows. This is somewhat more complex
     and currently requires the (freely available) Cygnus Win32
     development libraries -described below.


   In order to compile Ciao for Win32 environments you need to have
the (public domain) _Cygnus Win32_ and development libraries
installed in your system. Compilation should be performed preferably
under Windows NT-type systems.

   * Thus, the first step, if Cygnus Win32 is not installed in your
     system, is to download it (from, e.g.,
     `http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32') and install it. The
     compilation process also requires that the executables `rm.exe',
     `sh.exe', and `uname.exe' from the Cygnus distribution be copied
     under `/bin' prior to starting the process (if these executables
     are not available under `/bin' the compilation process will
     produce a number of errors and eventually stop prematurely).

   * Assuming all of the above is installed, type `./ciaosetup
     allwin32'. This will compile both the engine and the Ciao
     libraries. In this process, system libraries that are normally
     linked dynamically under Un*x (i.e., those for which `.so'
     dynamically loadable files are generated) are linked statically
     into the engine (this is done instead of generating `.dll's
     because of a limitation in the current version of the Cygnus
     Win32 environment). No actual installation is made at this
     point, i.e., this process leaves things in a similar state as if
     you had just downloaded and uncompressed the precompiled
     distribution. Thus, in order to complete the installation you
     should now:

   * Follow now the instructions in *note Installing Ciao from a
     Win32 binary distribution::.


   A further note regarding the executables generated by the Ciao
compiler and top-level: the same considerations given in *note
Installing Ciao from a Win32 binary distribution:: apply regarding
`.bat' files, etc. However, in a system in which Cygnus Win32 is
installed these executables can also be used in a very simple way. In
fact, the executables can be run as in Un*x by simply typing their
name at the `bash' shell command line without any associated `.bat'
files. This only requires that the `bash' shell which comes with
Cygnus Win32 be installed and accessible: simply, make sure that `/bin/sh.exe'
exists.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Porting to currently unsupported operating systems,  Next: Troubleshooting (nasty messages and nifty workarounds),  Prev: Installation and compilation under Windows,  Up: Installing Ciao from the source distribution

237.7 Porting to currently unsupported operating systems
========================================================

If you would like to port Ciao to a currently unsupported platform,
there are several issues to take into account. The main one is to get
the _engine_ to compile in that platform, i.e., the C code under the
`engine' directory. The procedure currently followed by Ciao to
decide the various flags needed to compile is as follows:

   * The shell script `$(CIAOSRC)/etc/ciao_get_arch' is executed; it
     returns a string describing the operating system and the
     processor architecture (e.g., LINUXi86, SolarisSparc,
     SolarisAlpha, etc.). You should make sure it returns a correct
     (and meaningful) string for your setup. This string is used
     trhoughout the compilation to create several
     architecture-dependant flags.

   * In the directory `$(CIAOSRC)/makefile-sysdep' there are files
     called mkf-<OS><ARCH> for every combination of operating system
     and architecture in which Ciao is know to (and how to) compile.
     They set several flags regarding, for example, whether to use or
     not threads, which threads library to use, the optimization
     flags to use, the compiler, linker, and it also sets separately
     the architecture name (ARCHNAME variable) and the operating
     system (OSNAME). You should create a new mkf file for your
     machine, starting from the one which is closest to you.

   * Most times the porting problems happen in the use of locks and
     threads. You can either disable them, or have a look at the
     files `$(CIAOSRC)/engine/locks.h' and
     `$(CIAOSRC)/engine/threads.h'. If you know how to implement
     native (assembler) locks for your architecture, enable
     HAVE_NATIVE_SLOCKS for your architecture and add the
     definitions. Otherwise, if you have library-based locks, enable
     them. The mechanism in `threads.h' is similar.


   Once a working engine is achieved, it should be possible to
continue with the standard installation procedure, which will try to
use a completely static version of the standalone compiler
(`ciaoc.sta' in the `ciaoc' directory) to compile the interactive
top-level ( `ciaosh') and a new version of the standalone compiler ( `ciaoc').
These in turn should be able to compile the Ciao libraries. You may
also need to look at some libraries (such as, for example, `sockets')
which contain C code. If you do succeed in porting to a platform that
is currently unsupported please send the `mkf-CIAOARCH' and any
patches to <ciao@clip.dia.fi.upm.es>, and we will include them (with
due credit, of course) in the next distribution.

237.8 Troubleshooting (nasty messages and nifty workarounds)
============================================================

The following a list of common installation problems reported by
users:

   * *Problem:* Compilation errors appear when trying a new
     installation/compilation after the previous one was aborted
     (e.g., because of errors).

     *Possible reason and solution:* It is a good idea to clean up
     any leftovers from the previous compilation using `./ciaosetup
     engclean' before restarting the installation or compilation
     process.

   * *Problem:*

     During engine compilation, messages such as the following
     appear: `tasks.c:102:PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS undeclared
     (first use of this function)'.

     *Possible reason and solution:*

     Your (Linux?) system does not have (yet) the Posix threads
     library installed. You can upgrade to one which does have it, or
     download the library from

     `http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/linuxthreads/index.html'

     and install it, or disable the use of threads in Linux: for
     this, edit the `SETTINGS' file and specify `USE_THREADS=no',
     which will avoid linking against thread libraries (it will
     disable the use of thread-related primitives as well). Clean the
     engine with `./ciaosetup engclean' and restart compilation.

     If you have any alternative threads library available, you can
     tinker with `engine/threads.h' and the files under
     `makefile-sysdep' in order to get the task managing macros right
     for your system. Be sure to link the right library. If you
     succeed, we (<ciao@clip.dia.fi.upm.es>) will be happy of knowing
     about what you have done.

   * *Problem:*

     `-lpthread: library not found' (or similar)

     *Possible reason and solution:*

     Your (Linux?) system seems to have Posix threads installed, but
     there is no threads library in the system. In newer releases
     (e.g., RedHat 5.0), the Posix threads system calls have been
     included in `glibc.so', so specifying `-lpthread' in
     `makefile-sysdep/mkf-LINUX' is not needed; remove it.
     `./ciaosetup engclean' and restart installation.

     Alternatively, you may have made a custom installation of Posix
     threads in a non-standard location: be sure to include the flag
     `-L/this/is/where/the/posix/libraries/are' *before* `-lpthread',
     and to update `/etc/ld.so.conf' (see `man ldconfig').

   * *Problem:*

     `Segmentation Violation' (when starting the first executable)

     *Possible reason and solution:*

     This has been observed with certain older versions of `gcc'
     which generated erroneous code under full optimization. The best
     solution is to upgrade to a newer version of `gcc'.
     Alternatively, lowering the level of optimization (by editing the `SETTINGS'
     file in the main directory of the distribution) normally solves
     the problem, at the cost of reduced execution speed.

   * *Problem:* `ciaoc:
     /home/clip/lib/ciao/ciao-X.Y/engine/ciaoengine: not found'

     *Possible reason and solution:*

        * The system was not fully installed and the variable
          `CIAOENGINE' was not set.

        * The system was installed, the variable `CIAOENGINE' is set,
          but it is does not point to a valid ciaoengine.


     See the file `LIBROOT/ciao/DOTcshrc' for user settings for
     environment variables.

   * *Problem:*

     `ERROR: File library(compiler) not found - aborting...' (or any
     other library is not found)

     *Possible reason and solution:*

        * The system was not installed and the variable `CIAOLIB' was
          not set.

        * The system is installed and the variable `CIAOLIB' is wrong.


     See the file `LIBROOT/ciao/DOTcshrc' for user settings for
     environment variables.

   * *Problem:*

     `ERROR: File <some_directory>/<some_file>.itf not found -
     aborting...'

     *Possible reason and solution:*

     Can appear when compiling `.pl' files. The file to compile
     (<some_file>.pl) is not in the directory <some_directory>. You
     gave a wrong file name or you are in the wrong directory.

   * *Problem:*

     `*ERROR*: /(write_option,1) is not a regular type' (and similar
     ones)

     *Possible reason and solution:*

     This is not a problem, but rather the type checker catching some
     minor inconsistencies which may appear while compiling the
     libraries. Bug us to remove it, but ignore it for now.

   * *Problem:*

     `WARNING: Predicate <some_predicate>/<N> undefined in module
     <some_module>'

     *Possible reason and solution:*

     It can appear when the compiler is compiling Ciao library
     modules. If so, ignore it (we will fix it). If it appears when
     compiling user programs or modules, you may want to check your
     program for those undefined predicates.

   * *Problem:*

     `gmake[1]: execve:
     /home/clip/mcarro/ciao-0.7p2/etc/collect_modules: No such file
     or directory'

     *Possible reason and solution:*

     Check if collect_modules is in $(CIAOSRC)/etc and is executable.
     If it is not here, your distribution is incorrect: please let us
     know.

   * *Problem:*

     `make: Fatal error in reader: SHARED, line 12: Unexpected end of
     line seen'

     *Possible reason and solution:*

     You are using standard Un*x make, not GNU's make implementation
     (gmake).

   * *Problem:*

     `WARNING's or `ERROR's while compiling the Ciao libraries during
     installation.

     *Possible reason and solution:*

     It is possible that you will see some such errors while
     compiling the Ciao libraries during installation. This is
     specially the case if you are installing a Beta or Alpha release
     of Ciao. These releases (which have "odd" version numbers such
     as 1.5 or 2.1) are typically snapshots of the development
     directories, on which many developers are working
     simultaneously, which may include libraries which have typically
     not been tested yet as much as the "official" distributions
     (those with "even" version numbers such as 1.6 or 2.8). Thus,
     minor warnings may not have been eliminated yet or even errors
     can sneak in. These warnings and errors should not affect the
     overall operation of the system (e.g., if you do not use the
     affected library).

238 Installing Ciao from a Win32 binary distribution
****************************************************

*Author(s):* Daniel Cabeza, Manuel Carro, Manuel Hermenegildo.

   This describes the installation of Ciao after downloading the
Windows _binary_ (i.e., _precompiled_) distribution. It includes the
installation of libraries and manuals and applies to Windows
95/98/NT/2000/XP systems. This is the simplest Windows installation,
since it requires no compilation and is highly recommended. However,
it is also possible to compile Ciao from the source distribution on
these systems (please refer to *note Installing Ciao from the source
distribution:: for details).

   If you find any problems during installation, please refer to
*note Troubleshooting (nasty messages and nifty workarounds)::.  See
also *note Downloading new versions:: and *note Reporting bugs::.

238.1 Win32 binary installation summary
=======================================

Please follow these steps (below we use the terms _folder_ and
_directory_ interchangeably):

  1. Download the precompiled distribution and unpack it into any
     suitable folder, such as, e.g., `C:\Program Files'.

     This will create there a folder whose name reflects the Ciao
     version. Due to limitations of Windows related to file
     associations, do not put Ciao too deep in the folder hierarchy.
     For unpacking you will need a recent version of a zip archive
     manager - there are many freely available such as `WinZip', `unzip', `pkunzip',
     etc. (see for example `www.winzip.com'). Some users have
     reported some problems with version 6.2 of WinZip, but no
     problems with, e.g., version 7. With WinZip, simply click on
     "Extract" and select the extraction folder as indicated above.

  2. Stop any Ciao-related applications.

     If you have a previous version of Ciao installed, make sure you
     do not have any Ciao applications (including, e.g., a toplevel
     shell) running, or the extraction process may not be able to
     complete. You may also want to delete the entire folder of the
     previous installation to save space.

  3. Open the Ciao source directory created during extraction and run
     (e.g. by double-clicking on it) the `install'(`.bat') script.
     Answer "yes" to the dialog that pops up and type any character
     in the installation window to finish the process. You may need
     to reboot for the changes in the registry to take effect.

     This will update the windows registry (the file `ciao'(`.reg')
     lists the additions) and also create some `.bat' files which may
     be useful for running Ciao executables from the command line. It
     also creates initialization scripts for the `emacs' editor. The
     actions performed by the installation script are reported in the
     installation window.

  4. You may want to add a _windows shortcut_ in a convenient place,
     such as the desktop, to `ciaosh.cpx', the standard interactive
     toplevel shell. It is located inside the `shell' folder (e.g.,
     click on the file `ciaosh.cpx' with the right mouse button and
     select the appropriate option, `Send to->Desktop as shortcut').

  5. You may also want to add another shortcut to the file `ciao'(`.html')
     located inside `doc\reference\ciao_html' so that you can open
     the Ciao manual by simply double-clicking on this shortcut.

  6. Finally, if the (freely available) `emacs' editor/environment is
     not installed in your system, we _highly recommend_ that you
     also install it at this point. While it is easy to use Ciao with
     any editor of your choice, the Ciao distribution includes a very
     powerful _application development environment_ which is based on `emacs'
     and which enables, e.g., source-level debugging, syntax
     coloring, context-sensitive on-line help, etc. If you are not
     convinced, consider that many programmers inside Micros*ft use
     `emacs' for developing their programs.

     The emacs editor (in all its versions: Un*x, Windows, etc.) can
     be downloaded from, for example, `http://www.emacs.org/', and
     also from the many GNU mirror sites worldwide (See
     `http://www.gnu.org/' for a list), in the `gnu/emacs' and
     `gnu/windows/emacs' directories. You can find answers to
     frequently asked questions (FAQ) about `emacs' in general at
     `http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-faq.text' and about the
     Windows version at
     `http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html'
     (despite the `ntemacs' name it runs fine also as is on Win9X and
     Win2000 machines).

     You need to tell `emacs' how to load the Ciao mode automatically
     when editing and how to access the on-line documentation:

        * Start `emacs' (double click on the icon or from the `Start'
          menu). Open (menu `Files->Open File' or simply <^X><^F>)
          the file `ForEmacs.txt' that the installation script has
          created in directory where you installed the Ciao
          distribution.

        * Copy the lines in the file (select with the mouse and then
          menu `Edit->Copy'). Open/Create using `emacs' (menu
          `Files->Open File' or simply <^X><^F>) the file `~/.emacs'
          (or, if this fails, `c:/.emacs').

        * Paste the two lines (menu `Edit->Paste' or simply <^Y>)
          into the file and save (menu `Files->Save Buffer' or simply
          <^X><^S>).

        * Exit `emacs' and start it again.


     `emacs' should not report any errors (at least related to Ciao)
     on startup. At this point the `emacs' checks in the following
     section should work.



File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Checking for correct installation on Win32,  Next: Compiling the miscellaneous utilities under Windows,  Prev: Win32 binary installation summary,  Up: Installing Ciao from a Win32 binary distribution

238.2 Checking for correct installation on Win32
================================================

After the actions and registry changes performed by the installation
procedure, you should check that the following should work correctly:

   * Ciao-related file types (`.pl' source files, `.cpx' executables,
     `.itf,.po,.asr' interface files, `.pls' scripts, etc.) should
     have specific icons associated with them (you can look at the
     files in the folders in the Ciao distribution to check).

   * Double-clicking on the shortcut to `ciaosh'(`.cpx') on the
     desktop should start the typical Prolog-style top-level shell in
     a window. If this shortcut has not been created on the desktop,
     then double-clicking on the `ciaosh'(`.cpx') icon inside the
     `shell' folder within the Ciao source folder should have the
     same effect.

   * In the top-level shell, Ciao library modules should load
     correctly. Type for example `use_module(library(dec10_io)).' at
     the Ciao top-level prompt -you should get back a prompt with no
     errors reported.

   * To exit the top level shell, type `halt.' as usual, or <^D>.


Also, the following documentation-related actions should work:

   * Double-clicking on the shortcut to `ciao'(`.html') which appears
     on the desktop should show the Ciao manual in your default WWW
     browser. If this shortcut has not been created you can
     double-click on the `ciao'(`.html') file in the
     `doc\reference\ciao_html' folder inside the Ciao source folder.
     Make sure you configure your browser to use _style sheets_ for
     correct formatting of the manual (note, however, that some older
     versions of Explorer did not support style sheets well and will
     give better results turning them off).

   * The `doc\reference' folder contains the manual also in the other
     formats present in the distribution, such as `info' (very
     convenient for users of the `emacs' editor/program development
     system) and `postscript' or `pdf', which are specially useful
     for printing. See *note Printing manuals (Win32):: for
     instructions.


Finally, if `emacs' is installed, after starting it (double-clicking
on the `emacs' icon or from the `Start' menu) the following should
work:

   * Typing <^H> <i> (or in the menus `Help->Manuals->Browse Manuals
     with Info') should open a list of manuals in info format in
     which the Ciao manual(s) should appear.

   * When opening a Ciao file, i.e., a file with `.pl' or `.pls'
     ending, using <^X><^F>`filename' (or using the menus) the code
     should appear highlighted according to syntax (e.g., comments in
     red), and `Ciao/Prolog' menus should appear in the menu bar on
     top of the `emacs' window.

   * Loading the file using the `Ciao/Prolog' menu (or typing <^C>
     <l>) should start in another emacs buffer the Ciao toplevel
     shell and load the file. You should now be able to switch the
     the toplevel shell and make queries from within `emacs'.


*Note*: when using `emacs' it is _very convenient_ to swap the
locations of the (normally not very useful) <Caps Lock> key and the
(very useful in `emacs') <Ctrl> key on the keyboard. How to do this
is explained in the `emacs' frequently asked questions FAQs (see the `emacs'
download instructions for their location).

   If you find that everything works but `emacs' cannot start the
Ciao toplevel you may want to check if you can open a normal Windows
shell within `emacs' (just do <M-x> `shell'). If you cannot, it is
possible that you are using some anti-virus software which is causing
problems. See
`http://www.gnu.org/software/emac/windows/faq3.html#anti-virus' for a
workaround.

   In some Windows versions it is possible that you had to change the
_first_ backslashes in the ciao-mode-init.el file in the Ciao
Directory. E.g., assuming you have installed in drive `c:', instances
of `c:\' need to be changed to `c:/'. For example:
`c:\prolog/ciao-1.7p30Win32/shell/ciaosh.bat' should be changed to
`c:/prolog/ciao-1.7p30Win32/shell/ciaosh.bat'.

238.3 Compiling the miscellaneous utilities under Windows
=========================================================

The `etc' folder contains a number of utilities, documented in the
manual in _PART V - Miscellaneous Standalone Utilities_. In the Win32
distribution these utilities are not compiled by the installation
process. You can create the executable for each of them when needed
by compiling the corresponding `.pl' file.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Server installation under Windows,  Next: CGI execution under IIS,  Prev: Compiling the miscellaneous utilities under Windows,  Up: Installing Ciao from a Win32 binary distribution

238.4 Server installation under Windows
=======================================

If you would like to install Ciao on a server machine, used by
several clients, the following steps are recommended:

   * Follow the standard installation procedure on the server. When
     selecting the folder in which Ciao is installed make sure you
     select a folder that is visible by the client machines. Also
     make sure that the functionality specified in the previous
     sections is now available on the server.

   * Perform a _client installation_ on each client, by running
     (e.g., double-click on it) the `client.bat' script. This should
     update the registry of each client. At this point all the
     functionality should also be available on the clients.



File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: CGI execution under IIS,  Next: Uninstallation under Windows,  Prev: Server installation under Windows,  Up: Installing Ciao from a Win32 binary distribution

238.5 CGI execution under IIS
=============================

The standard installation procedure updates the windows registry so
that Ciao executables (ending in `.cpx') are directly executable as
CGIs under Microsoft's IIS, i.e., so that you make applications
written in Ciao available on the WWW (see the `pillow' library for
specific support for this task). In the event you re-install IIS, you
probably would lose the entries in the registry which allow this. In
that case, processing the file `ciao.reg' produced during the
installation (or simply reinstalling Ciao) will add those entries
again.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Uninstallation under Windows,  Prev: CGI execution under IIS,  Up: Installing Ciao from a Win32 binary distribution

238.6 Uninstallation under Windows
==================================

To uninstall Ciao under Windows, simply delete the directory in which
you put the Ciao distribution. If you also want to delete the
registry entries created by the Ciao installation (not strictly
needed) this must currently be done by hand. The installation leaves
a list of these entries in the file `ciao.reg' to aid in this task.
Also, all the register entries contain the word _ciao_. Thus, to
delete all Ciao entries, run the application `regedit' (for example,
by selecting `Run' from the Windows `Start' menu), search (<^F>) for
_ciao_ in all registry entries (i.e., select all of `Keys', `Values',
and `Data' in the `Edit->Find' dialog), and delete each matching key
(click on the left window to find the matching key for each entry
found).

239.1 Architecture-specific notes and limitations
=================================================

Ciao makes use of advanced characteristics of modern architectures
and operating systems such as multithreading, shared memory, sockets,
locks, dynamic load libraries, etc., some of which are sometimes not
present in a given system and others may be implemented in very
different ways across the different systems. As a result, currently
not all Ciao features are available in all supported operating
systems. Sometimes this is because not all the required features are
present in all the OS flavors supported and sometimes because we
simply have not had the time to port them yet.

   The current state of matters is as follows:

LINUX:
     multithreading, shared DB access, and locking working.

Solaris:
     multithreading, shared DB access, and locking working.

IRIX:
     multithreading, shared DB access, and locking working.

SunOS 4:
     multithreading, shared DB access, and locking NOT working.

Win 95/98/NT/2000/XP:
     multithreading, shared DB access, and locking working. Dynamic
     linking of object code (C) libraries NOT working.

Mac OS X (Darwin):
     multithreading, shared DB access, and locking working.

   The features that do not work are disabled at compile time.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Keeping up to date with the Ciao users mailing list,  Next: Downloading new versions,  Prev: Architecture-specific notes and limitations,  Up: Beyond installation

239.2 Keeping up to date with the Ciao users mailing list
=========================================================

We recommend that you join the Ciao _users mailing list_
(`ciao-users@clip.dia.fi.upm.es'), in order to receive information on
new versions and solutions to problems. Simply send a message to
<ciao-users-request@clip.dia.fi.upm.es>, containing in the body only
the word:

   `subscribe'

alone in one line. Messages in the list are strictly limited to
issues directly related to Ciao and your email address will of course
be kept strictly confidential. You mail also want to subscribe to the
`comp.lang.prolog' newsgroup.

   There is additional info available on the Ciao system, other CLIP
group software, publications on the technology underlying these
systems, etc. in the CLIP group's WWW site
`http://clip.dia.fi.upm.es'.


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Downloading new versions,  Next: Reporting bugs,  Prev: Keeping up to date with the Ciao users mailing list,  Up: Beyond installation

239.3 Downloading new versions
==============================

Ciao and its related libraries and utilities are under constant
improvement, so you should make sure that you have the latest
versions of the different components, which can be dowloaded from: 

   `http://clip.dia.fi.upm.es/Software'


File: ciao-1.14.2.info.tmp,  Node: Reporting bugs,  Prev: Downloading new versions,  Up: Beyond installation

239.4 Reporting bugs
====================

If you still have problems after downloading the latest version and
reading the installation instructions you can send a message to
<ciao-bug@clip.dia.fi.upm.es>. Please be as informative as possible
in your messages, so that we can reproduce the bug.

   * For _installation problems_ we typically need to have the
     version and patch number of the Ciao package (e.g., the name of
     the file downloaded), the output produced by the installation
     process (you can capture it by redirecting the output into a
     file or cutting and pasting with the mouse), and the exact
     version of the Operating System you are using (as well as the C
     compiler, if you took a source distribution).

   * For _problems during use_ we also need the Ciao and OS versions
     and a small example of code which we can run to reproduce the
     bug.
