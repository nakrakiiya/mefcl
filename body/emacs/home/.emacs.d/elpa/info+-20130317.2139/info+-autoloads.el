(autoload 'Info-merge-subnodes "info+" "\
Integrate current node with nodes referred to in its Menu.

Displays the current Info node, together with the nodes in its Menu.
Buffer `*Info: NODE*' is used for the display, where NODE is the name
of the current node.  The contents of this node's subnodes (the nodes
named in this node's Menu) are included in the buffer, following the
contents of the current node.

Optional arg RECURSIVE-DISPLAY-P (prefix arg if interactive) governs
the way menus of subnodes are treated:

  If nil, nothing additional happens.  Subnode menus are not explored.
  Only the current node and its immediate subnodes are documented, in
  the single display buffer `*Info: NODE*'.

  If non-nil, then the subnodes of a node are treated in the same way
  as the parent node, recursively: If any of them has, itself, a Menu,
  then that menu's subnodes are also explored, and so on.

    If RECURSIVE-DISPLAY-P is zero, then a single display buffer is
    used for all of the nodes explored.  Otherwise, a separate display
    buffer is used for each subnode that has a Menu (see next).

      Use this when you want a single, flat compilation of the current
      node and all of its subnodes.  It is less appropriate when the
      current node has several levels of subnodes: The flattened
      result can be difficult to read.

    If RECURSIVE-DISPLAY-P is positive, then the contents of each
    subnode are displayed twice: once in the parent node's display,
    and once in the subnode's own display.

      Use this when the current node has several levels of subnodes
      and you want each display buffer to be self-contained.

    If RECURSIVE-DISPLAY-P is negative, then there is no redundancy: A
    subnode's contents are only displayed in its parent's buffer.  The
    subnode's own display buffer only contains the contents of its own
    subnodes.

      Use this when the current node has several levels of subnodes
      and you want no redundancy between the display buffers.

The user option (variable) `Info-subtree-separator' is a string to be
inserted by `Info-merge-subnodes' just before the title of each
node (preceding its description).  By default it is \"\\n* \", producing
a node title resembling a menu item.  Setting this to \"\\f\\n* \" will
cause a page break before each node description.  For more on setting
this variable, type \\<Info-mode-map>`\\[describe-variable] Info-subtree-separator'.

------

Optional second arg RECURSIVE-CALL-P is only for internal use.  It is
used to indicate whether (non-nil) or not (nil) this is a recursive
\(i.e. not a top-level) call to `Info-merge-subnodes'.  Non-nil
means that this is a subnode, and that its contents should only be
included in the present display if RECURSIVE-DISPLAY-P is also
non-nil.  For proper operation when RECURSIVE-DISPLAY-P is zero, the
non-nil value of RECURSIVE-CALL-P should be the node name of the
top-level call to `Info-merge-subnodes'.
